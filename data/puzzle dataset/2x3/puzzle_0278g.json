This means that Brandy's favorite color must be burnt umber.\n\nNow, let's look at the first clue again. We know that Brandy's favorite flower is either the California poppy or the dahlia. Since Brandy's favorite color is burnt umber, and the person with the California poppy has rose pink as their favorite color, Brandy's favorite flower must be the dahlia.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n* Brandy's favorite color: burnt umber\n* Brandy's favorite flower: dahlia\n\nNow, let's look at Travis. We know that Travis's favorite color is not burnt umber (because Brandy's favorite color is burnt umber), so Travis's favorite color must be rose pink.\n\nWe also know that Travis's favorite flower is not the dahlia (because Brandy's favorite flower is the dahlia), so Travis's favorite flower must be the California poppy.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n* Travis's favorite color: rose pink\n* Travis's favorite flower: California poppy",
