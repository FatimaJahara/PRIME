Since Stacey is already a possibility for autoimmune disorders from the first clue, this clue does not add new information about Stacey's health condition but tells us that ammunition is associated with either Stacey or someone with autoimmune disorders.\n\nThe third clue, \"Matthew does not have a weapon of mass destruction,\" directly tells us that Matthew's weapon is ammunition because it's the only other option.\n\nNow, combining the information from the second and third clues, since Matthew uses ammunition and the second clue associates ammunition with either Stacey or someone with autoimmune disorders, and knowing Matthew is not Stacey, Matthew must be the one with autoimmune disorders.\n\nGiven that Matthew has autoimmune disorders, and from the first clue, Stacey either has autoimmune disorders or Parkinson's disease, Stacey must have Parkinson's disease because Matthew already has autoimmune disorders.\n\nTherefore, the health conditions are assigned as follows: Matthew has autoimmune disorders, and Stacey has Parkinson's disease.\n\nFor the weapons, since Matthew uses ammunition, Stacey must use the weapon of mass destruction.",
