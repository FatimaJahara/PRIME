Since Billy's favourite movie is 13 Going on 30, and Megan either has an estate or 13 Going on 30 as her favourite movie, we can conclude that Megan has an estate as her housing type.\n\nThe only remaining item in the \"Favourite Movie\" category is Rambo, which must be paired with Billy's name. However, we already know that Billy's favourite movie is 13 Going on 30, so Rambo must be paired with Megan's name.\n\nThe only remaining item in the \"Housing Type\" category is tepee, which must be paired with Billy's name.",
