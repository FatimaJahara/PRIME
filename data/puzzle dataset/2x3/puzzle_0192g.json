This means that the person associated with C/2022 E3 cannot wear the same clothing as the person associated with Comet Arend-Roland.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that of Pamela and the person who wears agbada, one is associated with Comet C/2022 E3, and the other is associated with Comet Arend-Roland. This means that Pamela cannot be associated with C/2022 E3, because if she were, the person who wears agbada would also have to be associated with C/2022 E3, which would violate the second clue.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that of Pamela and the person who has the comet c/2022 e3, one wears an agbada, and the other wears a tutu skirt. This means that Pamela must wear a tutu skirt, because if she wore an agbada, the person associated with C/2022 E3 would also have to wear an agbada, which would violate the second clue.\n\nNow we can conclude that:\n\n* Pamela wears a tutu skirt and is associated with Comet Arend-Roland.\n* Seth wears an agbada and is associated with C/2022 E3.",
