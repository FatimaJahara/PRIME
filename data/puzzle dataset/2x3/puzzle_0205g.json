This is because there are only two movie genres, and if the person who likes chiffon does not prefer political thrillers, they must prefer the other genre, which is period dramas.\n\nFrom the second clue, \"The person who likes period dramas is not named Katie,\" we can deduce that the person who likes period dramas must be named Zachary. This is because there are only two names, and if the person who likes period dramas is not named Katie, they must be named Zachary.\n\nNow, we can combine the information from the two clues. We know that the person who likes chiffon prefers period dramas, and we also know that the person who likes period dramas is named Zachary. Therefore, we can conclude that Zachary likes chiffon and period dramas.\n\nThe only remaining person is Katie, who must like political thrillers (since Zachary likes period dramas) and lycra (since Zachary likes chiffon).",
