However, we cannot conclude that Erin's pet is Cookie or that Erin's favourite movie is \"13 Going on 30\" based on this clue alone.\n\nFrom the second clue, \"Of Curtis and the person with a pet named Barkley, one has 13 Going on 30 as their favourite movie, and the other has Black Hawk Down as their favourite movie,\" we know that Curtis and the person with the pet named Barkley have different favourite movies. Since there are only two favourite movies, and one of them is \"13 Going on 30\", the other must be \"Black Hawk Down\". This clue also tells us that Curtis and the person with the pet named Barkley are two separate individuals.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both clues. If the person with the pet named Cookie is not Erin, then their favourite movie must be \"13 Going on 30\". However, we know from the second clue that Curtis and the person with the pet named Barkley have different favourite movies, and one of them is \"13 Going on 30\". Therefore, the person with the pet named Cookie cannot be Curtis, because Curtis's favourite movie is either \"13 Going on 30\" or \"Black Hawk Down\", but not both. This means that the person with the pet named Cookie must be Erin.\n\nSince Erin's pet is Cookie, and the person with the pet named Cookie either has \"13 Going on 30\" as their favourite movie or is named Erin, we can conclude that Erin's favourite movie is indeed \"13 Going on 30\".\n\nNow, let's look at Curtis. We know that Curtis and the person with the pet named Barkley have different favourite movies, and one of them is \"13 Going on 30\". Since Erin's favourite movie is \"13 Going on 30\", Curtis's favourite movie must be \"Black Hawk Down\". We also know that Curtis is not the person with the pet named Barkley, so Curtis's pet must be Cookie.\n\nHowever, we already concluded that Erin's pet is Cookie, so Curtis's pet cannot be Cookie. This means that Curtis's pet must be Barkley.",
