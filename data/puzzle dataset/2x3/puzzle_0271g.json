Since we already know that the person who prefers power tools has beryl, Rachel must have opal.\n\nNow, let's look at the shopping preferences. We know that the person who prefers power tools has beryl, but we don't know who that person is yet. However, we do know that Rachel has opal, and from the second clue, we know that the person who prefers facial masks has either opal or beryl. Since Rachel already has opal, the person who prefers facial masks must have beryl. But we already know that the person who prefers power tools has beryl, so the person who prefers facial masks cannot have beryl. Therefore, the person who prefers facial masks must be Rachel.\n\nNow we know that Rachel prefers facial masks and has opal.
