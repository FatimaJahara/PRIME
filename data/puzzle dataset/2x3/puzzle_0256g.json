But then Person A cannot have a victorian dollhouse (from clue 3), which means Person B must have a victorian dollhouse. However, this contradicts clue 5, which states that the person who has a vintage old wrench does not have tear gas. Therefore, Person A cannot have tear gas.\n\n* Since Person A does not have tear gas (from clue 2), and the person who uses tear gas is either Person A or Person B (from clue 4), then Person B must have tear gas.\n\n* Now, from clue 3, we know that of Person A and the person who has tear gas (Person B), one has a vintage old wrench, and the other has a victorian dollhouse. Since Person B has tear gas, Person A must have a vintage old wrench.\n\n* Finally, since Person A has a vintage old wrench, Person B must have a victorian dollhouse (from clue 1).",
