This means that one of them has kidney cancer, and the other has a pet named Biscuit.\n\nFrom the second clue, \"Of Lauren and the person with a pet named Champ, one has kidney cancer, and the other has urinary tract infections.\", we can deduce that Lauren and the person with a pet named Champ cannot both have kidney cancer, and they cannot both have urinary tract infections. This means that one of them has kidney cancer, and the other has urinary tract infections.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Jeremy has kidney cancer, then Lauren has a pet named Biscuit (from the first clue). But then, Lauren cannot have urinary tract infections (from the second clue), which means the person with a pet named Champ must have urinary tract infections. However, this would mean that Jeremy has kidney cancer and the person with a pet named Champ has urinary tract infections, which contradicts the second clue.\n* Therefore, Jeremy cannot have kidney cancer. This means that Lauren has kidney cancer (from the first clue), and Jeremy has a pet named Biscuit.\n* Now, from the second clue, we know that Lauren has kidney cancer, and the person with a pet named Champ has urinary tract infections. Since Jeremy has a pet named Biscuit, the person with a pet named Champ must be Lauren. But this would mean that Lauren has both kidney cancer and urinary tract infections, which is not possible.\n* Therefore, the person with a pet named Champ must be Jeremy. But this would mean that Jeremy has both a pet named Biscuit and a pet named Champ, which is not possible.\n* Therefore, our initial assumption that Jeremy has a pet named Biscuit must be incorrect. This means that Lauren has a pet named Biscuit, and Jeremy has a pet named Champ.\n* Now, from the first clue, we know that one of Jeremy and Lauren has kidney cancer, and the other has a pet named Biscuit. Since Lauren has a pet named Biscuit, Jeremy must have kidney cancer.\n* Finally, from the second clue, we know that Lauren has kidney cancer, and the person with a pet named Champ has urinary tract infections.
