The three people are the one who likes friendship dramas, the one with the milk snake, and the one with lemon chess pie.\n    - This clue tells us that these three people are distinct and have different preferences.\n\n12. Of William and the person who has water pie, one has a russell's viper, and the other has a milk snake.\n    - This clue tells us that William and the person with water pie have different snakes, either Russell's viper or milk snake.\n\nUsing these clues, we can start to deduce the preferences of each person.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person with the Dubois' sea snake is either Courtney or someone who eats key lime chiffon pie. From clue 7, we know that Douglas does not like key lime chiffon pie, so the person with the Dubois' sea snake cannot be Douglas. From clue 4, we know that Courtney does not have the Russell's viper, so the person with the Dubois' sea snake must be Courtney.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that William does not have the Dubois' sea snake or the milk snake. From clue 12, we know that William and the person with water pie have different snakes, either Russell's viper or milk snake. Since William does not have the milk snake, he must have the Russell's viper.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that the person who likes musicals and the person with the milk snake have different types of pies, either cranberry or water. From clue 8, we know that the person who enjoys musicals has either cranberry or lemon chess pie. Since the person with the milk snake has water pie, the person who likes musicals must have cranberry pie.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that the person who likes war movies does not have lemon chess pie. From clue 11, we know that the three people are the one who likes friendship dramas, the one with the milk snake, and the one with lemon chess pie. Since the person with the milk snake has water pie, the person who likes friendship dramas must have lemon chess pie.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that the person who likes friendship dramas does not have a dubois' sea snake. Since Courtney has the Dubois' sea snake, the person who likes friendship dramas must be Leah.\n\nFrom clue 9, we know that the person with kraits either likes musicals or has water pie. Since the person with the milk snake has water pie, the person with kraits must like musicals.\n\nFrom clue 10, we know that Leah does not like cranberry pie. Since the person who likes musicals has cranberry pie, Leah must like friendship dramas.",
