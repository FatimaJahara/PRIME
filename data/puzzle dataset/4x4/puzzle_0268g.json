This means that the person with Ant-Man and the person with Beast Boy cannot be the same person.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that of Kristin and the person with the Anti-Monitor, one has Ant-Man, and the other has Sabretooth as their Marvel character. This means that Kristin cannot have Ant-Man, and the person with the Anti-Monitor cannot have Sabretooth.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person whose favorite DC Comic Character is Black Canary either likes Ego the Living Planet from Marvel or enjoys watching maternal dramas. This means that the person with Black Canary cannot have Ant-Man or Sabretooth.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that of Curtis and Kristin, one likes fantasy romance movies, and the other has Beast Boy as their DC Comic Character. This means that Curtis and Kristin cannot both have Beast Boy, and one of them must have fantasy romance movies.\n\nFrom the fifth clue, we know that of Curtis and Katrina, one is associated with the Suicide Squad, and the other prefers the monster movie genre. This means that Curtis and Katrina cannot both have the Suicide Squad, and one of them must have the monster movie genre.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* Curtis cannot have Beast Boy (from clue 4), so Curtis must have either the Suicide Squad or the monster movie genre (from clue 5). If Curtis has the Suicide Squad, then Katrina must have the monster movie genre. But then, Curtis cannot have fantasy romance movies (from clue 4), so Curtis must have the monster movie genre, and Katrina must have the Suicide Squad.\n* Kristin cannot have Ant-Man (from clue 2), so Kristin must have either Sabretooth or Ego the Living Planet. But Kristin cannot have Ego the Living Planet (from clue 3), so Kristin must have Sabretooth.\n* The person with Ant-Man cannot have Beast Boy (from clue 1), so the person with Ant-Man must be either Travis or Katrina. But Travis cannot have Ant-Man (from clue 1), so Katrina must have Ant-Man.\n* The person with Beast Boy cannot have Ant-Man (from clue 1), so the person with Beast Boy must be either Curtis or Kristin. But Curtis cannot have Beast Boy (from clue 4), so Kristin must have Beast Boy.\n* The person with Black Canary cannot have Ant-Man or Sabretooth (from clue 3), so the person with Black Canary must be either Travis or Curtis. But Curtis cannot have Black Canary (from clue 4), so Travis must have Black Canary.",
