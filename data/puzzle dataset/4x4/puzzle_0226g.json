Let's assign Person D to the tear gas category, as it is the only category that has not been mentioned in relation to Person D.\n\nPerson D: tear gas\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person who likes fashion and glamour movies is associated with either the tadpole galaxy or the cartwheel galaxy. Let's assign the person who likes fashion and glamour movies to the cartwheel galaxy, as it is the only galaxy that has not been mentioned in relation to this person.\n\nPerson ?: fashion and glamour movies, cartwheel galaxy\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that the person who has tear gas is associated with either the tadpole galaxy or the NGC 253 galaxy. Since Person D is already associated with tear gas, we can assign Person D to the NGC 253 galaxy.\n\nPerson D: tear gas, NGC 253\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that Person B is not associated with Sextans B or Tadpole Galaxy. Let's assign Person B to the Sextans B galaxy, as it is the only galaxy that has not been mentioned in relation to Person B.\n\nPerson B: Sextans B\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that Person C and the person with a cannon prefer different movie genres. Let's assign Person C to the political thrillers category, as it is the only category that has not been mentioned in relation to Person C.\n\nPerson C: political thrillers\n\nFrom Clue 6, we know that Person C is one of the three people, and the other two are associated with fashion and glamour movies and the flail. Let's assign the person who likes fashion and glamour movies to Person A, as it is the only person who has not been mentioned in relation to this category.\n\nPerson A: fashion and glamour movies, cartwheel galaxy\n\nNow we can fill in the remaining categories.\n\nPerson B: Sextans B, romantic comedy, tripwire\n\nPerson C: political thrillers, cannon, NGC 253\n\nPerson D: tear gas, NGC 253, dystopian action",

Of the person who likes fashion and glamour movies and the one with a flail, one is associated with the tadpole galaxy, and the other is associated with the cartwheel galaxy.\n   - This clue gives us information about the galaxy associations of the person who likes fashion and glamour movies and the person with a flail.\n\n3. Of the person who has tear gas and the one who likes political thrillers, one is associated with the tadpole galaxy, and the other is associated with the NGC 253 galaxy.\n   - This clue provides information about the galaxy associations of the person with tear gas and the person who likes political thrillers.\n\n4. Neither the person from Sextans B galaxy nor the one from Tadpole galaxy is named Mark.\n   - This clue tells us that Mark is not associated with either the Sextans B galaxy or the Tadpole galaxy.\n\n5. Of Melinda and the person with a cannon, one prefers political thrillers, and the other prefers dystopian action.\n   - This clue gives us information about the movie genre preferences of Melinda and the person with a cannon.\n\n6. The three people are the one who likes fashion and glamour movies, the one with the flail, and Melinda.\n   - This clue tells us that Melinda is one of the three people, and the other two are associated with fashion and glamour movies and the flail.\n\n7. Neither the person who knows ngc 253 nor the one who knows tadpole galaxy is named Mark.\n   - This clue is similar to clue 4 and reinforces the information that Mark is not associated with either the NGC 253 galaxy or the Tadpole galaxy.\n\nUsing the process of elimination and combining the information from the clues, we can deduce the correct assignments for each person.",
