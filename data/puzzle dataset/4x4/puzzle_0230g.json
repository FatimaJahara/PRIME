This means that Person A is not one of these three people.\n\n- From clue 5, we know that the person who plays golf is either Person A or Person D. Since Person A is not one of the three people mentioned in clue 4, Person A must be the one who plays golf.\n\n- From clue 3, we know that Person A and the person who does kickboxing have different gems, one being tanzanite and the other diopside. Since Person A plays golf, the person who does kickboxing must have diopside as their gem.\n\n- From clue 6, we know that Person B and the person with diopside have different insects, one being a louse and the other a ground beetle. Since the person who does kickboxing has diopside as their gem, Person B must have a louse as their insect.\n\n- From clue 1, we know that Person B and the person who does pom squad have different insects, one being a mantis and the other a louse. Since Person B has a louse as their insect, the person who does pom squad must have a mantis as their insect.\n\n- From clue 2, we know that Person D and the person who does pom squad have different gems, one being tanzanite and the other zoisite. Since Person D is not one of the three people mentioned in clue 4, Person D must have zoisite as their gem.\n\n- From clue 3, we know that Person A and the person who does kickboxing have different gems, one being tanzanite and the other diopside. Since Person A plays golf, Person A must have tanzanite as their gem.\n\n- The only remaining gem is sphene, which must belong to Person C.\n\n- The only remaining insect is lacewing, which must belong to Person C.\n\n- The only remaining sport is fastpitch softball, which must belong to Person C.",

Since Lindsey is not the one with the louse (from clue 2), Lindsey must be the one who plays fastpitch softball.\n\n- From clue 3, we know that Bradley and the person who plays fastpitch softball have different gems, one being tanzanite and the other diopside. Since Lindsey plays fastpitch softball, Bradley must have tanzanite.\n\n- From clue 2, we know that Lindsey and the person who plays golf have different gems, one being tanzanite and the other zoisite. Since Lindsey plays fastpitch softball, the person who plays golf must have zoisite.\n\n- From clue 1, we know that Justin and the person who plays golf have different insects, one being a mantis and the other a louse. Since the person who plays golf has zoisite, Justin must have the louse.\n\n- From clue 6, we know that Justin and the person with diopside have different insects, one being a louse and the other a ground beetle. Since Justin has the louse, the person with diopside must have the ground beetle.\n\n- From clue 5, we know that either Bradley or Lindsey is on the pom squad. Since Lindsey plays fastpitch softball, Bradley must be on the pom squad.\n\n- The only remaining sport is kickboxing, which must be played by Heather.\n\n- The only remaining gem is sphene, which must be associated with Heather.\n\n- The only remaining insect is lacewing, which must be associated with Lindsey.",

Since Lindsey is not the one with the louse (from clue 2), Lindsey must be the one who plays golf.\n\n- From clue 3, we know that Bradley and the person who plays golf have different gems, one being tanzanite and the other diopside. Since Lindsey plays golf, Bradley must have tanzanite.\n\n- From clue 5, we know that either Bradley or Lindsey participates in kickboxing. Since Lindsey plays golf, Bradley must participate in kickboxing.\n\n- From clue 1, we know that Justin and the person who plays fastpitch softball have different insects, one being a mantis and the other a louse. Since Justin is not the one with the louse (from clue 6), Justin must have a mantis.\n\n- From clue 6, we know that Justin and the person with diopside have different insects, one being a louse and the other a ground beetle. Since Justin has a mantis, the person with diopside must have a ground beetle.\n\n- From clue 2, we know that Lindsey and the person who plays fastpitch softball have different gems, one being tanzanite and the other zoisite. Since Lindsey plays golf, the person who plays fastpitch softball must have zoisite.\n\n- The only remaining gem is sphene, which must be assigned to Heather.\n\n- The only remaining insect is lacewing, which must be assigned to Heather.\n\n- The only remaining sport is pom squad, which must be assigned to Heather.",
