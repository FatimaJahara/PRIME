Person B does not drink stout.\n   - This clue tells us that Person B's beverage is not stout.\n\n3. Of Person D and the person who knows Wilson's theorem, one has puzzle locks, and the other has nonograms.\n   - This clue tells us that Person D and the person who knows Wilson's theorem have puzzle locks and nonograms, but we don't know which one has which.\n\n4. The three people are the one named Person A, the one with the Riesz representation theorem, and the one with a cosmopolitan beverage.\n   - This clue tells us that Person A is one of the three people, and the other two are the ones with the Riesz representation theorem and a cosmopolitan beverage.\n\n5. Neither the person who studies Ceva's theorem nor the one who studies Riesz Representation Theorem drinks cosmopolitan.\n   - This clue tells us that the person who studies Ceva's theorem and the person who studies Riesz Representation Theorem do not drink cosmopolitan.\n\n6. Neither the person who studies Ceva's theorem nor the one who studies Riesz Representation Theorem drinks iced tea.\n   - This clue tells us that the person who studies Ceva's theorem and the person who studies Riesz Representation Theorem do not drink iced tea.\n\n7. The person who drinks bourbon is either Person A or Person B.\n   - This clue tells us that the person who drinks bourbon is either Person A or Person B.\n\n8. Of the person who has the Riesz representation theorem and the one who drinks stout, one likes Fibonacci sequence puzzles, and the other likes nonograms.\n   - This clue tells us that the person who has the Riesz representation theorem and the person who drinks stout have Fibonacci sequence puzzles and nonograms, but we don't know which one has which.\n\n9. The three people are the one named Person A, the one who drinks bourbon, and the one who solves puzzle locks.\n   - This clue tells us that Person A is one of the three people, and the other two are the ones who drink bourbon and solve puzzle locks.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we have:\n\n- Person B is one of the three people, and the other two are the ones with Desargues' theorem and nonograms.\n- Person B does not drink stout.\n- Person D and the person who knows Wilson's theorem have puzzle locks and nonograms.\n- Person A is one of the three people, and the other two are the ones with the Riesz representation theorem and a cosmopolitan beverage.\n- The person who studies Ceva's theorem and the person who studies Riesz Representation Theorem do not drink cosmopolitan or iced tea.\n- The person who drinks bourbon is either Person A or Person B.\n- The person who has the Riesz representation theorem and the person who drinks stout have Fibonacci sequence puzzles and nonograms.\n- Person A is one of the three people, and the other two are the ones who drink bourbon and solve puzzle locks.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that:\n\n- Person B has Desargues' theorem and nonograms.\n- Person A has the Riesz representation theorem and a cosmopolitan beverage.\n- Person D has Wilson's theorem and puzzle locks.\n- Person C has Ceva's theorem and iced tea.\n- The person who drinks bourbon is Person A.\n- The person who drinks stout has Fibonacci sequence puzzles.",

From clue 1, we know that the three people are the one with Desargues' theorem, the one named John, and the one with nonograms. This means that John is not the one with Desargues' theorem, and the one with nonograms is not John.\n\n2. From clue 2, we know that John does not drink stout. This means that John drinks either iced tea, bourbon, or cosmopolitan.\n\n3. From clue 3, we know that Erica and the person who knows Wilson's theorem are either puzzle locks or nonograms. Since we already know that the one with nonograms is not John, Erica must be the one with nonograms, and the person who knows Wilson's theorem must be the one with puzzle locks.\n\n4. From clue 4, we know that Seth, the one with the Riesz representation theorem, and the one who drinks bourbon are the three people. This means that Seth is not the one with the Riesz representation theorem, and the one who drinks bourbon is not Seth.\n\n5. From clue 5, we know that neither the person who studies Ceva's theorem nor the one who studies Riesz representation theorem drinks bourbon. This means that the person who studies Ceva's theorem drinks either iced tea, stout, or cosmopolitan.\n\n6. From clue 6, we know that neither the person who studies Ceva's theorem nor the one who studies Riesz representation theorem drinks cosmopolitan. This means that the person who studies Ceva's theorem drinks either iced tea or stout.\n\n7. From clue 7, we know that the person who drinks iced tea is either Seth or John. Since we already know that John drinks either iced tea, bourbon, or cosmopolitan, and Seth is not the one with the Riesz representation theorem, Seth must be the one who drinks iced tea.\n\n8. From clue 8, we know that the person who knows the Riesz representation theorem and the one who drinks stout are either Fibonacci sequence puzzles or nonograms. Since we already know that Erica is the one with nonograms, the person who knows the Riesz representation theorem must be the one with Fibonacci sequence puzzles.\n\n9. From clue 9, we know that Seth, the one who drinks iced tea, and the one with puzzle locks are the three people. Since we already know that Seth is the one who drinks iced tea, and Erica is the one with nonograms, Brandy must be the one with puzzle locks.\n\nNow, let's summarize the information we have:\n\n- Seth drinks iced tea and is not the one with the Riesz representation theorem.\n- John does not drink stout and is not the one with Desargues' theorem.\n- Erica is the one with nonograms and Wilson's theorem.\n- Brandy is the one with puzzle locks.\n- The person who studies Ceva's theorem drinks either iced tea or stout.\n- The person who knows the Riesz representation theorem is the one with Fibonacci sequence puzzles.\n\nUsing this information, we can fill in the grid:",
