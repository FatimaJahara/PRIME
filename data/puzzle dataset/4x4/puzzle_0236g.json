From Clue 11, we also know that Person C has a bongo as their mammal.\n\nFrom Clue 1, since Person C's favorite color is cherry blossom pink, the person with the red panda as their mammal must be either Person A or Person D.\n\nFrom Clue 8, we know that neither the person with bulbasaur nor the person with spearow has a red panda as their mammal. This means that the person with the red panda must have either weepinbell or tentacruel as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nFrom Clue 10, we know that of Person D and the person who has Spearow, one has a donkey, and the other has a red panda. Since Person D cannot have spearow (because of Clue 8), Person D must have the red panda.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that the person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Bulbasaur is either Person B or has baby yellow as their favorite color. Since Person B cannot have bulbasaur (because of Clue 8), Person B must have baby yellow as their favorite color.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that the three people are the one whose favorite color is baby yellow, the one with the donkey, and the one with Tentacruel. Since Person B has baby yellow as their favorite color, Person B must be one of the three people. The other two people must be Person A and Person D.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person whose associated mammal is a donkey either has Spearow or Weepinbell as their Pok\u00e9mon character. Since Person A is the only person left who can have the donkey, Person A must have either Spearow or Weepinbell as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nFrom Clue 6, we know that the person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow is either Person B or has midnight blue as their favorite color. Since Person B cannot have spearow (because of Clue 8), Person A must have midnight blue as their favorite color.\n\nFrom Clue 7, we know that the person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow either has the glyptodon as their mammal or has deep green as their favorite color. Since Person A has midnight blue as their favorite color, Person A must have the glyptodon as their mammal.\n\nFrom Clue 9, we know that neither the person with bulbasaur nor the person with spearow has a red panda as their mammal. This means that Person C must have bulbasaur as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nThe only Pok\u00e9mon character left is Weepinbell, which must be Person D's Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nThe only mammal left is the donkey, which must be Person B's mammal.\n\nThe only favorite color left is deep green, which must be Person D's favorite color.",

The person whose favourite color is baby yellow is either named Kristy or has the red panda as their mammal. (Clue 1)\n2. The person whose associated mammal is a donkey either has Spearow or Weepinbell as their Pok\u00e9mon character. (Clue 2)\n3. The person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Bulbasaur is either named Zachary or has midnight blue as their favourite color. (Clue 3)\n4. The three people are the one whose favourite color is midnight blue, the one with the donkey, and the one with Tentacruel. (Clue 4)\n5. The person whose name is Kristy has baby yellow as their favourite color. (Clue 5)\n6. The person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow is either named Zachary or has cherry blossom pink as their favourite color. (Clue 6)\n7. The person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow either has the glyptodon as their mammal or has deep green as their favourite color. (Clue 7)\n8. Neither the person with bulbasaur nor the one with spearow has a red panda as their mammal. (Clue 8)\n9. Neither the person whose favorite color is midnight blue nor the one whose favorite color is baby yellow has tentacruel as their Pok\u00e9mon character. (Clue 9)\n10. Of Kristen and the person who has Spearow, one has a donkey, and the other has a red panda. (Clue 10)\n11. The person whose favorite color is baby yellow has a bongo as their mammal. (Clue 11)\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that Kristy's favourite color is baby yellow. From Clue 11, we know that the person whose favorite color is baby yellow has a bongo as their mammal. Therefore, Kristy's mammal is a bongo.\n\nFrom Clue 1, we know that the person whose favourite color is baby yellow is either named Kristy or has the red panda as their mammal. Since Kristy's favourite color is baby yellow and her mammal is a bongo, the person who has the red panda as their mammal cannot have baby yellow as their favourite color.\n\nFrom Clue 8, we know that neither the person with bulbasaur nor the one with spearow has a red panda as their mammal. Therefore, the person who has the red panda as their mammal must have either Weepinbell or Tentacruel as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that the three people are the one whose favourite color is midnight blue, the one with the donkey, and the one with Tentacruel. Since the person who has the red panda as their mammal cannot have baby yellow as their favourite color, and the person who has baby yellow as their favourite color is Kristy, the person who has the red panda as their mammal must be either Timothy or Kristen.\n\nFrom Clue 10, we know that of Kristen and the person who has Spearow, one has a donkey, and the other has a red panda. Since the person who has the red panda as their mammal must be either Timothy or Kristen, and Kristen cannot have the red panda as her mammal (because she has a donkey), the person who has the red panda as their mammal must be Timothy.\n\nFrom Clue 6, we know that the person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow is either named Zachary or has cherry blossom pink as their favourite color. Since the person who has Spearow as their Pok\u00e9mon character has either the glyptodon as their mammal or has deep green as their favourite color (Clue 7), and the person who has the glyptodon as their mammal is not Zachary (because Zachary has either Spearow or Bulbasaur as his Pok\u00e9mon character), the person who has Spearow as their Pok\u00e9mon character must have deep green as their favourite color.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that the person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Bulbasaur is either named Zachary or has midnight blue as their favourite color. Since the person who has midnight blue as their favourite color is not Zachary (because Zachary has either Spearow or Bulbasaur as his Pok\u00e9mon character), the person who has Bulbasaur as their Pok\u00e9mon character must be Zachary.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person whose associated mammal is a donkey either has Spearow or Weepinbell as their Pok\u00e9mon character. Since the person who has Spearow as their Pok\u00e9mon character has deep green as their favourite color, the person who has the donkey as their mammal must have Weepinbell as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nFrom Clue 9, we know that neither the person whose favorite color is midnight blue nor the one whose favorite color is baby yellow has tentacruel as their Pok\u00e9mon character. Since the person who has midnight blue as their favourite color is not Zachary (because Zachary has either Spearow or Bulbasaur as his Pok\u00e9mon character), the person who has midnight blue as their favourite color must be Kristen.",

(Clue 4)\n   - This clue tells us that the three people are the ones with baby yellow, donkey, and Tentacruel.\n\n5. The person whose name is Kristy has midnight blue as their favourite color. (Clue 5)\n   - This clue directly assigns midnight blue to Kristy.\n\n6. The person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow is either named Zachary or has deep green as their favourite color. (Clue 6)\n   - This clue tells us that either Zachary's Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow or the person with deep green as their favourite color has Spearow as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\n7. The person whose Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow either has the glyptodon as their mammal or has cherry blossom pink as their favourite color. (Clue 7)\n   - This clue tells us that the person with Spearow has either the glyptodon or cherry blossom pink as their favourite color.\n\n8. Neither the person with bulbasaur nor the one with spearow has a red panda as their mammal. (Clue 8)\n   - This clue tells us that neither the person with Bulbasaur nor the person with Spearow has the red panda as their mammal.\n\n9. Neither the person whose favorite color is baby yellow nor the one whose favorite color is midnight blue has tentacruel as their Pok\u00e9mon character. (Clue 9)\n   - This clue tells us that neither the person with baby yellow nor the person with midnight blue has Tentacruel as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\n10. Of Kristen and the person who has Spearow, one has a donkey, and the other has a red panda. (Clue 10)\n    - This clue tells us that either Kristen has a donkey and the person with Spearow has a red panda, or Kristen has a red panda and the person with Spearow has a donkey.\n\n11. The person whose favorite color is midnight blue has a bongo as their mammal. (Clue 11)\n    - This clue directly assigns the bongo to the person with midnight blue.\n\nUsing the above clues, we can start by assigning midnight blue to Kristy (Clue 5) and the bongo to the person with midnight blue (Clue 11). We can also assign the donkey to the person with either Spearow or Weepinbell (Clue 2).\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that the three people are the ones with baby yellow, donkey, and Tentacruel. Since Kristy has midnight blue, she cannot be one of these three people. Therefore, the person with baby yellow, the person with the donkey, and the person with Tentacruel must be Timothy, Zachary, and Kristen.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that either Zachary's Pok\u00e9mon character is Bulbasaur or the person with baby yellow has Bulbasaur as their Pok\u00e9mon character. Since Zachary cannot have baby yellow (Clue 4), the person with baby yellow must have Bulbasaur as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nFrom Clue 6, we know that either Zachary's Pok\u00e9mon character is Spearow or the person with deep green has Spearow as their Pok\u00e9mon character. Since Zachary cannot have deep green (Clue 4), the person with deep green must have Spearow as their Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nFrom Clue 7, we know that the person with Spearow has either the glyptodon or cherry blossom pink as their favourite color. Since the person with deep green has Spearow, they must have either the glyptodon or cherry blossom pink as their favourite color.\n\nFrom Clue 10, we know that either Kristen has a donkey and the person with Spearow has a red panda, or Kristen has a red panda and the person with Spearow has a donkey. Since the person with Spearow has deep green, they cannot have a donkey (Clue 4). Therefore, Kristen must have a donkey, and the person with Spearow must have a red panda.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person with the donkey has either Spearow or Weepinbell as their Pok\u00e9mon character. Since Kristen has a donkey, she must have either Spearow or Weepinbell as her Pok\u00e9mon character. However, the person with Spearow has deep green, so Kristen must have Weepinbell as her Pok\u00e9mon character.\n\nThe only remaining Pok\u00e9mon character is Tentacruel, which must belong to Timothy. The only remaining mammal is the glyptodon, which must belong to Zachary. The only remaining favourite color is cherry blossom pink, which must belong to Zachary.",
