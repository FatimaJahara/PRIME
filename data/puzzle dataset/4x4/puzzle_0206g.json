However, this is not possible since each person can only study one topic. Therefore, clue 8 must be referring to a different person. This means that the person with blonde hair must be studying qualitative and quantitative analysis.\n\n- From clue 7, we know that Luke is either a crane operator or a diver, and from clue 4, we know that Luke is either a crane operator or has strawberry blonde hair. However, clue 3 tells us that the person with blonde hair is either a crane operator or a diver. Therefore, Luke must have strawberry blonde hair.\n\n- From clue 2, we know that the person with platinum blonde hair either studies stoichiometry or works as a pedicurist. However, clue 1 tells us that John and the pedicurist study stoichiometry and pharmaceutical chemistry, respectively. Therefore, the person with platinum blonde hair must be Natasha, and she must study stoichiometry.\n\n- From clue 5, we know that John and Natasha are not divers. Therefore, Jamie must be the diver.\n\n- From clue 9, we know that Luke either studies qualitative and quantitative analysis or pharmaceutical chemistry. However, clue 8 tells us that the person with blonde hair studies qualitative and quantitative analysis. Therefore, Luke must study pharmaceutical chemistry.\n\n- From clue 1, we know that John and the pedicurist study stoichiometry and pharmaceutical chemistry, respectively. However, we already know that Luke studies pharmaceutical chemistry, and Natasha studies stoichiometry. Therefore, John must be the pedicurist.\n\n- The only occupation left is manicurist, which must be the person with blonde hair.",

Therefore, clue 8 must be referring to a different person with blonde hair, which is Natasha.\n- From clue 9, we know that Luke either studies qualitative and quantitative analysis or pharmaceutical chemistry. Since Luke is a diver (clue 7), he cannot study qualitative and quantitative analysis (clue 8). Therefore, Luke studies pharmaceutical chemistry.\n- From clue 1, we know that John and the crane operator study stoichiometry and pharmaceutical chemistry, respectively. Since Luke studies pharmaceutical chemistry, John must study stoichiometry.\n- From clue 2, we know that the person with platinum blonde hair either studies stoichiometry or works as a crane operator. Since John studies stoichiometry, the person with platinum blonde hair must be the crane operator, which is Natasha.\n- From clue 3, we know that the person with blonde hair is either a pedicurist or a manicurist. Since Luke has blonde hair and is a diver, he cannot be a pedicurist or a manicurist. Therefore, the person with blonde hair must be Jamie, who is a manicurist.\n- From clue 4, we know that the person with strawberry blonde hair is either a pedicurist or named Luke. Since Luke has blonde hair, the person with strawberry blonde hair must be a pedicurist, which is John.",
