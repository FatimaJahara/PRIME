This means that:\n\n* The person who studies wave optics cannot have a monkey puzzle tree.\n* The person who studies wave optics cannot have a wall-mounted skateboard.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that Kelly and the person with a wall-mounted skateboard have different items in the \"Trees\" category. Since one of them has an orange tree and the other has a monkey puzzle tree, we can conclude that:\n\n* Kelly has either an orange tree or a monkey puzzle tree.\n* The person with a wall-mounted skateboard has either an orange tree or a monkey puzzle tree.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Scott has an orange tree, then Kelly must be studying nanotechnology (from the first clue). But then, Kelly cannot have an orange tree (from the third clue), which is a contradiction. Therefore, Scott cannot have an orange tree.\n* If Scott is studying nanotechnology, then Kelly must have an orange tree (from the first clue). But then, Kelly cannot have a monkey puzzle tree (from the third clue), which means the person with a wall-mounted skateboard must have a monkey puzzle tree. This is possible.\n\nSo, we can conclude that:\n\n* Scott is studying nanotechnology.\n* Kelly has an orange tree.\n\nNow, let's look at the \"Decoration\" category. We know that the person who studies wave optics either has an orange tree or a canopy bed. Since Kelly has an orange tree, Kelly cannot be studying wave optics. Therefore, Scott must be studying wave optics (since Scott is studying nanotechnology, which is not wave optics).\n\nSince Scott is studying wave optics, Scott must have either an orange tree or a canopy bed. But Scott cannot have an orange tree (since Kelly has it), so Scott must have a canopy bed.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that:\n\n* Kelly has a wall-mounted skateboard (since Scott has a canopy bed).",
