The person whose favourite TV show is Game of Thrones either uses the cable car or the chairlift as their transportation mode.\n   - This means that the person who likes Game of Thrones cannot use the same transportation mode as Person A, who uses the cable car.\n\n2. The person whose name is Person A has the leviathan as their monster.\n   - This directly assigns the leviathan to Person A.\n\n3. Of Person A and the person who likes Game of Thrones, one has the leviathan, and the other has the gargoyle as their monster.\n   - Since Person A has the leviathan, the person who likes Game of Thrones must have the gargoyle.\n\n4. The person whose name is Person A uses the cable car as their transportation mode.\n   - This directly assigns the cable car to Person A.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid based on the deductions:\n\n- Person A has the leviathan as their monster and uses the cable car as their transportation mode.\n- The person who likes Game of Thrones has the gargoyle as their monster and cannot use the cable car, so they must use the chairlift.\n- Since Person A's favourite TV show is not specified, and the person who likes Game of Thrones cannot be Person A (because they have different monsters and transportation modes), Person A's favourite TV show must be Keeping Up with the Kardashians.",

Since Brent uses the cable car, the person whose favourite TV show is Game of Thrones must use the chairlift as their transportation mode. \n\nFrom clue 3, we know that one of Brent or the person who has Game of Thrones as their favourite TV show has the leviathan, and the other has the gargoyle as their monster. Since Brent already has the leviathan, the person who has Game of Thrones as their favourite TV show must have the gargoyle as their monster. \n\nNow, let's look at the remaining person, Brandy. Since Brandy is not Brent, and the person who has Game of Thrones as their favourite TV show is not Brent, Brandy must have Keeping Up with the Kardashians as their favourite TV show. \n\nAlso, since Brandy is not the person who has Game of Thrones as their favourite TV show, Brandy must use the cable car as their transportation mode.
