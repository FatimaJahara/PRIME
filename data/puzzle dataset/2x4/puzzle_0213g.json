Since Andrew likes tikka masala pizza, Lori must like quattro formaggi pizza. Therefore, Lori either uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke or wears high heels.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke is either named Andrew or likes quattro formaggi pizza. Since Lori likes quattro formaggi pizza, she must use the long dog paddle swimming stroke.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n* Andrew likes tikka masala pizza, so his \"Types of Pizza\" is \"tikka masala pizza\".\n* Lori likes quattro formaggi pizza, so her \"Types of Pizza\" is \"quattro formaggi pizza\".\n* Lori uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke, so her \"Swimming Stroke\" is \"long dog paddle\".\n* Since Lori uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke, Andrew must use the skulling swimming stroke, so his \"Swimming Stroke\" is \"skulling\".\n* Since Lori either uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke or wears high heels, and she uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke, Andrew must wear the cowboy hat, so his \"Clothing\" is \"cowboy hat\".\n* Therefore, Lori's \"Clothing\" is \"high heels\".",

Since Lori likes quattro formaggi pizza, she must either use the long dog paddle swimming stroke or wear a cowboy hat.\n\nThe third clue states that the person who uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke is either named Andrew or eats quattro formaggi pizza. We already know that Lori likes quattro formaggi pizza, so if she uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke, then Andrew must wear the cowboy hat. But if Andrew uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke, then Lori must wear the cowboy hat.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n1. Lori uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke and Andrew wears the cowboy hat:\n   - Lori: quattro formaggi pizza, long dog paddle swimming stroke, ?\n   - Andrew: tikka masala pizza, ?, cowboy hat\n\n2. Andrew uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke and Lori wears the cowboy hat:\n   - Lori: quattro formaggi pizza, ?, cowboy hat\n   - Andrew: tikka masala pizza, long dog paddle swimming stroke, ?\n\nIn both cases, Andrew must like tikka masala pizza, and Lori must like quattro formaggi pizza. Also, Lori must wear the cowboy hat, and Andrew must use the long dog paddle swimming stroke.\n\nThe only remaining category is \"Swimming Stroke\" for Lori.
