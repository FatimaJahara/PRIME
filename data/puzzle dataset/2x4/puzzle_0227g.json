Since Person B already has \"the book of animal ignorance\", the person with the cerebellum must read the Limca Book of Records.\n\nThe fourth clue tells us that of Person A and Person B, one has the Limca book of records, and the other has the spleen as their organ. Since Person B has \"the book of animal ignorance\", Person A must have the Limca book of records. This also means that Person B has the spleen.\n\nNow we know that Person A has the Limca book of records, and Person B has the spleen and \"the book of animal ignorance\".
