Since the person who enjoys death metal has a willow tree, they cannot have a nestling bird (because they enjoy death metal, not riot grrrl). Therefore, the person who enjoys death metal must have a rock dove.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that one of Shaun and the person who has a jacaranda tree listens to death metal, and the other listens to riot grrrl. Since we already know that the person who enjoys death metal has a willow tree, Shaun must have a jacaranda tree and listen to riot grrrl.\n\nNow we can fill in the rest of the grid:\n\n* Shaun has a jacaranda tree and listens to riot grrrl, so he must have a nestling bird (because the person who enjoys death metal has a rock dove).\n* Natalie has a willow tree and listens to death metal, so she must have a rock dove.",
