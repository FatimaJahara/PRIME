However, from the second clue, \"The person whose favourite season is the cherry blossom season was born in the year 2013,\" we know that the person who likes cherry blossom season was born in 2013, not 2002. Therefore, the person born in 2002 must be Nicholas.\n\nFrom the second clue, we also know that the person who likes cherry blossom season was born in 2013. Since Nicholas was born in 2002, the person who likes cherry blossom season must be Kristy.\n\nFrom the third clue, \"The person whose favourite color is cobalt blue does not have the cherry blossom season as their favourite season,\" we can deduce that the person who likes cobalt blue does not like cherry blossom season. Since Kristy likes cherry blossom season, Kristy's favourite color must be magenta. Therefore, Nicholas's favourite color must be cobalt blue.\n\nNow we have enough information to fill in the grid:",
