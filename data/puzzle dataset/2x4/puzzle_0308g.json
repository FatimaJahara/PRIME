But then, Erica cannot use flaxseed meal (from the second clue), and therefore, Erica must have the ice maze (from the first clue). However, this contradicts the third clue, which states that Brent does not have an ice maze. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.\n* If Erica uses flaxseed meal, then she must have the ice maze (from the first clue).
