This means that the person who prefers the monsoon season cannot participate in either of these sports.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that the person whose favourite season is monsoon does not live in a wickiup. This means that the person who prefers the monsoon season must live in a dormitory.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that of Person B and the person who likes the monsoon season, one does cheerleading, and the other does one-person dinghy or finn as their sport. Since the person who prefers the monsoon season cannot participate in cheerleading or one-person dinghy/finn (from the first clue), Person B must be the one who does cheerleading.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that the person who lives in a wickiup either has monsoon as their favourite season or participates in one-person dinghy or finn sports. Since the person who prefers the monsoon season lives in a dormitory (from the second clue), the person who lives in a wickiup must participate in one-person dinghy or finn sports.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we know:\n\n* Person B does cheerleading.\n* The person who prefers the monsoon season lives in a dormitory and does not participate in cheerleading or one-person dinghy/finn.\n* The person who lives in a wickiup participates in one-person dinghy or finn sports.\n\nSince Person B does cheerleading, Person A must be the one who prefers the monsoon season and lives in a dormitory. Person A cannot participate in cheerleading or one-person dinghy/finn, so Person A must participate in the remaining sport, which is not mentioned in the clues (but we can infer that it's not cheerleading or one-person dinghy/finn).\n\nThe person who lives in a wickiup participates in one-person dinghy or finn sports. Since Person A lives in a dormitory, Person B must be the one who lives in a wickiup. Person B does cheerleading, so Person B cannot participate in one-person dinghy or finn sports. This means that Person B must participate in the remaining sport, which is one-person dinghy/finn.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid:",
