This means that the person who likes lemon and asparagus pizza is either Person A or Person B, but we don't know which one yet.\n4.

Therefore, one of them is 155.0 cm tall and the other is 187.0 cm tall.\n\n3. The person who likes lemon and asparagus pizza is either 187.0 cm tall or 155.0 cm tall. (Clue 3)\n   - This means the person who likes white pizza is the other height.\n\n4. The person whose favorite mammal is a mammal does not have a height of 155.0. (Clue 4)\n   - This means the person whose favorite mammal is a mammal is 187.0 cm tall.\n\n5. Of Zachary and Christy, one has lemon and asparagus pizza, and the other has the arctic wolf as their mammal. (Clue 5)\n   - This means the person who likes lemon and asparagus pizza has the arctic wolf as their mammal, and the person who likes white pizza has the mammal as their mammal.\n\nFrom the above deductions, we can conclude that:\n\n- Christy likes white pizza and has the mammal as her mammal.\n- Zachary likes lemon and asparagus pizza and has the arctic wolf as his mammal.\n- Christy is 155.0 cm tall and Zachary is 187.0 cm tall.",
