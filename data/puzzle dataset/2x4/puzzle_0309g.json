Since the person who does heavy lifting is either Person A or Person B (Clue 2), the person who has a mountain as their landform type must be either Person A or Person B.\n\nFrom Clue 1, we know that the person who has a mountain as their landform type either does heavy lifting or dishwashing as their household chore. Since the person who has a mountain as their landform type is either Person A or Person B (previous step), and the person who does heavy lifting is either Person A or Person B (Clue 2), we can conclude that Person A has a mountain as their landform type and does dishwashing as their household chore.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that of Person B and the person who does heavy lifting, one has a pet named Clifford, and the other has a pet named Buster. Since Person A does dishwashing (previous step), Person B must do heavy lifting. Therefore, Person B has a pet named Clifford, and the person who does heavy lifting (Person B) has a pet named Buster.\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that of the person who has a volcano as their landform type and the one with a pet named Buster, one does heavy lifting, and the other does dishwashing. Since Person A does dishwashing (previous step) and has a mountain as their landform type, the person who has a volcano as their landform type must have a pet named Buster. However, we already know that Person B has a pet named Buster (previous step), so this clue does not provide any new information.",

This means that the person who has a mountain as their landform type cannot be the same person who does heavy lifting, as it would violate the \"either/or\" construct.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that the person who has a mountain as their landform type either has a pet named Buster or is responsible for the household chore of heavy lifting. This means that the person who has a mountain as their landform type cannot have a pet named Clifford, as it would violate the \"either/or\" construct.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that of Tonya and the person who does heavy lifting, one has Clifford as their pet, and the other has Buster as their pet. This means that Tonya cannot do heavy lifting, as it would violate the \"one/other\" construct.\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that of the person who has a volcano as their landform type and the one with a pet named Buster, one does heavy lifting, and the other does dishwashing.

This means that the person who has a volcano as their landform type cannot have a pet named Buster.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that of Tonya and the person who does dishwashing, one has Clifford as their pet, and the other has Buster as their pet.

This means that the person who has a volcano as their landform type cannot do dishwashing, and the person who has a pet named Buster cannot do heavy lifting.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Kyle has a mountain as his landform type, then he must do either dishwashing or heavy lifting (Clue 1).

But then, Kyle cannot have Buster as his pet either (Clue 3), which means Buster must be the pet of the person who has a volcano as their landform type. But this contradicts Clue 5, which says that the person who has a volcano as their landform type cannot do dishwashing.\n* Therefore, Kyle must have a volcano as his landform type. This means Tonya must have a mountain as her landform type (Clue 1).\n* Since Tonya has a mountain as her landform type, she must do either dishwashing or heavy lifting (Clue 1). But if she does heavy lifting, then Kyle must do dishwashing (Clue 2), which means Kyle cannot have Buster as his pet (Clue 4). But then, Tonya cannot have Buster as her pet either (Clue 3), which means Buster must be the pet of the person who has a volcano as their landform type. But this contradicts Clue 5, which says that the person who has a volcano as their landform type cannot do dishwashing.\n* Therefore, Tonya must do dishwashing. This means Kyle must do heavy lifting (Clue 2).\n* Since Tonya does dishwashing, she cannot have Buster as her pet (Clue 4). Therefore, Kyle must have Buster as his pet.\n* Finally, since Tonya has a mountain as her landform type and does dishwashing, she must have Clifford as her pet (Clue 3).",
