Since Person A has strawberry pie, Person B must have lemon icebox pie. Also, since Person A can't like both TV shows, and Person B can't like both TV shows, we can conclude that Person A likes Game of Thrones and Person B likes Pride and Prejudice.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who prefers Pride and Prejudice and the person who uses the funicular have different types of pies. We already know that the person who uses the funicular has lemon icebox pie, so the person who prefers Pride and Prejudice must have strawberry pie. But we already know that Person A has strawberry pie, so the person who prefers Pride and Prejudice must be Person B. Therefore, Person B uses the oil pipeline.\n\nNow we can fill in the grid:",
