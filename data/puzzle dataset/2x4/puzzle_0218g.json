This means that the person who has a cypress tree must have a speed limit traffic sign.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who has cypress trees either listens to gangsta rap or has a stop traffic sign. However, we already know from the second clue that the person who has a cypress tree does not have a stop traffic sign. Therefore, the person who has a cypress tree must listen to gangsta rap.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from the first and third clues. We know that Person B and the person who has a speed limit traffic sign like different types of music, and we also know that the person who has a cypress tree listens to gangsta rap. Since the person who has a cypress tree has a speed limit traffic sign (from the second clue), we can conclude that Person B listens to pop country.\n\nThe only remaining item in the \"Favourite Music\" category is gangsta rap, which must be assigned to Person A.
