The person who weighs 87 kg is either Person A or participates in 50-kilometer race walking.\n4. Of Person B and the person born in 2014, one does ribbon dancing, and the other does 50-kilometer race walking.\n5. The person whose name is Person B participates in 50-kilometer race walking.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that Person B participates in 50-kilometer race walking. From clue 4, we know that Person B and the person born in 2014 do different sports, so Person B cannot be born in 2014. Therefore, Person B must be born in 2011.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that the person who weighs 87 kg is either Person A or participates in 50-kilometer race walking. Since Person B participates in 50-kilometer race walking and weighs either 87 kg or 82 kg (clue 1), Person B must weigh 82 kg. Therefore, Person A weighs 87 kg.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Person A was either born in 2014 or 2011. Since Person B is born in 2011, Person A must be born in 2014.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that Person B and the person born in 2014 do different sports. Since Person B participates in 50-kilometer race walking, the person born in 2014 (Person A) must participate in ribbon dancing.",
