The person who eats sugar cream pie either studies elasticity or the laws of thermodynamics.\n   - This means that the person who eats sugar cream pie cannot study both elasticity and the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n2. The person who eats elderberry pie either likes thriller movies or studies the laws of thermodynamics.\n   - This means that the person who eats elderberry pie cannot like holiday romance movies or study elasticity.\n\n3. The person who studies elasticity in physics is either Person A or someone who eats sugar cream pie.\n   - This means that Person A either studies elasticity or eats sugar cream pie.\n\n4. Of Person A and Person B, one studies elasticity, and the other prefers sugar cream pie.\n   - This means that Person A and Person B have different preferences for physics topics and types of pies.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Person A studies elasticity, then Person B prefers sugar cream pie (from clue 4).\n  - From clue 1, Person B either studies the laws of thermodynamics or likes holiday romance movies.\n  - From clue 2, Person A either likes thriller movies or studies the laws of thermodynamics.\n  - But Person A cannot study both elasticity and the laws of thermodynamics (from clue 1).\n  - Therefore, Person A likes thriller movies, and Person B studies the laws of thermodynamics.\n\n- If Person A prefers sugar cream pie, then Person B studies elasticity (from clue 4).\n  - From clue 1, Person A either studies the laws of thermodynamics or likes holiday romance movies.\n  - From clue 2, Person B either likes thriller movies or studies the laws of thermodynamics.\n  - But Person B cannot study both elasticity and the laws of thermodynamics (from clue 1).\n  - Therefore, Person B likes thriller movies, and Person A studies the laws of thermodynamics.\n\nIn both cases, we get the same solution:",
