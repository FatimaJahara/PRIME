But then, the person with a chrysalis must have Skadi as their Norse god (from the third clue), which contradicts the fourth clue. Therefore, Person B cannot be charismatic.\n* If Person B is not charismatic, then they must be hesitant (since there are only two personalities). Then, the person with a chrysalis must be charismatic (since they cannot be hesitant, as that would leave Person B with no personality). From the second clue, the person with a chrysalis is either an Aesir Norse God or Person B. But we already know that Person B is not charismatic, so the person with a chrysalis must be an Aesir Norse God.\n* Now, we know that Person B is hesitant and not an Aesir Norse God, so they must be a Skadi Norse God. From the third clue, the person with a chrysalis has Aesir as their Norse god, so Person B has Skadi.\n* Finally, we know that Person A is charismatic (since Person B is hesitant) and has a silverfish as their insect (since Person B has a chrysalis).",
