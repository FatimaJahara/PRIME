This means that Person B cannot have the JS Izumo ship, because if they did, they would have to have the dryad monster, but the clue states that the person with the JS Izumo ship either has the dryad monster or is Person B, not both.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that of Person B and the person who prefers hiking boots, one has a dryad, and the other has a hag as their associated monster. Since Person B cannot have the JS Izumo ship, they must have the hag monster. This means that the person who prefers hiking boots must have the dryad monster.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person whose ship is the JS Izumo does not have a preference for scrunchies. This means that the person who prefers scrunchies must have the HMS Protector ship.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n* Person B has the hag monster and the HMS Protector ship.\n* The person who prefers hiking boots has the dryad monster and the JS Izumo ship.\n* The person who prefers scrunchies has the HMS Protector ship.\n\nSince Person A is the only person left, they must have the scrunchies and the HMS Protector ship.",
