This means Kyle's insect must be the walking stick.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that one of the people with a pet named Coco or a bedbug is Kyle, and the other is Kathleen. Since Kyle's insect is the walking stick, Kathleen must have the bedbug.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person whose favorite insect is the walking stick does not like electropop music. Since Kyle's insect is the walking stick, Kyle must like progressive rock music.\n\nNow, we can start filling in the grid:\n\n```\n{\n    \"kyle\": {\n        \"Favourite Music\": \"progressive rock\",\n        \"Insect\": \"walking stick\",\n        \"Pet Name\": \"?\"\n    },\n    \"kathleen\": {\n        \"Favourite Music\": \"?\",\n        \"Insect\": \"bedbug\",\n        \"Pet Name\": \"?\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSince Kyle's pet name is not Coco (because Kathleen has the bedbug and one of them has Coco), Kyle's pet name must be Buzz.\n\n```\n{\n    \"kyle\": {\n        \"Favourite Music\": \"progressive rock\",\n        \"Insect\": \"walking stick\",\n        \"Pet Name\": \"buzz\"\n    },\n    \"kathleen\": {\n        \"Favourite Music\": \"?\",\n        \"Insect\": \"bedbug\",\n        \"Pet Name\": \"?\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, since Kathleen's favorite music is not progressive rock (because Kyle likes that), Kathleen's favorite music must be electropop. And since Kathleen's pet name is not Buzz (because Kyle has that), Kathleen's pet name must be Coco.\n\n```\n{\n    \"kyle\": {\n        \"Favourite Music\": \"progressive rock\",\n        \"Insect\": \"walking stick\",\n        \"Pet Name\": \"buzz\"\n    },\n    \"kathleen\": {\n        \"Favourite Music\": \"electropop\",\n        \"Insect\": \"bedbug\",\n        \"Pet Name\": \"coco\"\n    }\n}\n```",
