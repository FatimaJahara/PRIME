Of the person who has work boots and the one with a weddell seal, one has cashmere, and the other has double knit as their type of fabric.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that Person A wears work boots. From clue 1, we know that Person A is the only one who wears work boots, so Person B must wear kitten heels.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Person B and the person who has cashmere wear different types of shoes. Since Person B wears kitten heels, the person who has cashmere must wear work boots. But we already know that Person A wears work boots, so Person A must have cashmere.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that the person who has work boots (Person A) and the person who has a weddell seal have different types of fabric. Since Person A has cashmere, the person who has a weddell seal must have double knit. But we already know that Person B wears kitten heels, so Person B must have a weddell seal.\n\nThe only remaining item is the marmoset, which must be paired with Person A.",
