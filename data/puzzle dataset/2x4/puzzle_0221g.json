This means that Person B cannot be dressed as the Wizard of Oz.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that the person who studies aldehydes and ketones is either Person A or has an interest in blue giant stars. This means that Person B cannot study aldehydes and ketones.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who has a protostar and the one studying polymer chemistry are dressed as the Wizard of Oz and the Queen or Queen of Hearts, respectively. This means that Person B cannot have a protostar.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Person A has a protostar, then Person B must have a blue giant (from the first clue). But then, Person B cannot study aldehydes and ketones (from the second clue), which means Person A must study aldehydes and ketones. However, this contradicts the third clue, which says that the person who has a protostar and the one studying polymer chemistry are dressed as the Wizard of Oz and the Queen or Queen of Hearts, respectively.\n* Therefore, Person B must have a protostar, and Person A must have a blue giant.\n\nNow, let's assign the Halloween costumes:\n\n* From the third clue, we know that the person who has a protostar (Person B) is dressed as the Wizard of Oz.\n* Therefore, Person A must be dressed as the Queen or Queen of Hearts.\n\nFinally, let's assign the chemistry topics:\n\n* From the second clue, we know that the person who studies aldehydes and ketones is either Person A or has an interest in blue giant stars. Since Person A has a blue giant, Person A must study aldehydes and ketones.\n* Therefore, Person B must study polymer chemistry.",
