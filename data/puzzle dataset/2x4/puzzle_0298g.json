The person who has energy crops does not have a wall-mounted skateboard as decoration.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know Person A does not live in a monastery. Therefore, Person A must live in a mosque (clue 2).\n\nFrom clue 1, Person A is either someone who has cozy d\u00e9cor or someone who has a wall-mounted skateboard. Since Person A lives in a mosque, they cannot have cozy d\u00e9cor (which is associated with a monastery, clue 4). Therefore, Person A must have a wall-mounted skateboard.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that the person who has energy crops does not have a wall-mounted skateboard as decoration (clue 5).
