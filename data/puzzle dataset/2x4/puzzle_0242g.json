Since Lindsey owns a Mil Mi-24 Hind aircraft, Lindsey cannot be the person who has luminous blue variable as their type of star (because Lindsey is already assigned to an aircraft). Therefore, Scott must be the person who has luminous blue variable as their type of star.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person whose Halloween costume is a soldier is interested in luminous blue variable stars. Since Scott is the person who has luminous blue variable as their type of star, Scott's Halloween costume must be a soldier.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n```\n{\n    \"scott\": {\n        \"Halloween Costume\": \"soldier\",\n        \"Types of Stars\": \"luminous blue variable\",\n        \"Aircraft\": \"?\"\n    },\n    \"lindsey\": {\n        \"Halloween Costume\": \"?\",\n        \"Types of Stars\": \"?\",\n        \"Aircraft\": \"mil mi-24 hind\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSince Scott's Halloween costume is a soldier, Lindsey's Halloween costume must be Velma (because there are only two options for Halloween costumes).\n\nSince Scott has luminous blue variable as their type of star, Lindsey must have late-type star as their type of star (because there are only two options for types of stars).\n\nSince Lindsey owns a Mil Mi-24 Hind aircraft, Scott must own a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar aircraft (because there are only two options for aircraft).",
