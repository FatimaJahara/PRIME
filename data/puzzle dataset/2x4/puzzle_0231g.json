Since Sandra has infant cereal, and we don't know what Nathan has yet, we can't determine which one has the taproot or the pirate ship.\n\nThe third clue, \"The person who has veal puree as baby food does not have a petiole as a plant part,\" tells us that the person with veal puree (which is Nathan, since Sandra has infant cereal) does not have a petiole. This means Nathan must have a taproot as his plant part, since there are only two options for plant parts.\n\nNow we can use the second clue again to determine that Sandra has a pirate ship as her toy, since Nathan has a taproot.\n\nFinally, we can fill in the remaining blanks: Nathan has veal puree as his baby food, and Sandra has a petiole as her plant part.",
