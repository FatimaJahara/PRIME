This means that the person with the puff adder cannot have Moon Knight as their Marvel character and cannot drive a Nissan GT-R.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that of the person who has a coastal taipan and the one with a Kia Forte, one has Mystique, and the other has Moon Knight as their Marvel character. This means that the person with the coastal taipan cannot have Mystique as their Marvel character, and the person with the Kia Forte cannot have Moon Knight as their Marvel character.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person whose name is Timothy likes Mystique as their Marvel character. This means that Timothy must have Mystique as his Marvel character.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Timothy has the puff adder as his snake, then he must drive a Kia Forte (from the first clue). But then, the person with the coastal taipan would have to have Moon Knight as their Marvel character (from the second clue), which means Courtney would have to have Moon Knight as her Marvel character. However, this would mean that Timothy and Courtney would both have Mystique as their Marvel character, which is not possible. Therefore, Timothy cannot have the puff adder as his snake.\n* If Timothy has the coastal taipan as his snake, then he must drive a Nissan GT-R (since he can't drive a Kia Forte, which is already ruled out). But then, the person with the puff adder would have to have Mystique as their Marvel character (from the first clue), which means Courtney would have to have Mystique as her Marvel character. However, this would mean that Timothy and Courtney would both have Mystique as their Marvel character, which is not possible. Therefore, Timothy cannot have the coastal taipan as his snake.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that Timothy has the Kia Forte as his car, and the puff adder as his snake is ruled out. Therefore, Timothy must have the Kia Forte as his car, and Courtney must have the Nissan GT-R as her car.\n\nNow, let's look at the snakes:\n\n* If Courtney has the puff adder as her snake, then she must have Moon Knight as her Marvel character (from the first clue). But then, Timothy would have to have Mystique as his Marvel character, which is already established. Therefore, Courtney can have the puff adder as her snake.\n* If Courtney has the coastal taipan as her snake, then she must have Mystique as her Marvel character (from the second clue). But then, Timothy would have to have Moon Knight as his Marvel character, which is not possible. Therefore, Courtney cannot have the coastal taipan as her snake.\n\nThe only remaining possibility is that Courtney has the puff adder as her snake, and Timothy has the coastal taipan as his snake.",
