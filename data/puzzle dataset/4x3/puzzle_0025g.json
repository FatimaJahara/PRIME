The three people are the one named Person A, the one with geophysics, and the one with the sword decoration.\n3. Of Person B and the person with a whiskey decanter, one studies geophysics, and the other studies quantum mechanics.\n4. Neither the person who studies dark matter and dark energy nor the one who studies quantum mechanics is Person A.\n5. The person who studies quantum mechanics is either Person A or Person C.\n6. The person who has a Victorian dollhouse as their decoration either studies geophysics or quantum mechanics.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Person A is not the one with geophysics or the sword decoration. Therefore, Person A must have the Victorian dollhouse decoration.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that the person with the Victorian dollhouse decoration either studies geophysics or quantum mechanics. Since Person A has the Victorian dollhouse decoration, Person A must study either geophysics or quantum mechanics.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that the person who studies quantum mechanics is either Person A or Person C. Since Person A is already assigned to study either geophysics or quantum mechanics, Person A must study quantum mechanics.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that of Person B and the person with a whiskey decanter, one studies geophysics, and the other studies quantum mechanics. Since Person A already studies quantum mechanics, Person B must study geophysics.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who studies dark matter and dark energy is either Person B or Person D. Since Person B already studies geophysics, Person D must study dark matter and dark energy.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that neither the person who studies dark matter and dark energy nor the one who studies quantum mechanics is Person A. Therefore, Person C must study dynamics.\n\nThe only decoration left is the sword, which must belong to Person C.\n\nThe only decoration left for Person B is the whiskey decanter.\n\nThe only decoration left for Person D is the embellished mirrors.",

This means that Dennis does not study dark matter and dark energy, and neither does the person with the Victorian dollhouse.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that of Sean and the person with embellished mirrors, one studies geophysics, and the other studies quantum mechanics. This means that Sean does not study dark matter and dark energy, because if he did, the person with embellished mirrors would have to study quantum mechanics, but we already know that the person who studies quantum mechanics is either Dennis or Melinda (from the fifth clue).\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that neither the person who studies dark matter and dark energy nor the one who studies quantum mechanics is named Dennis. This means that the person who studies dark matter and dark energy must be Megan, because we already know that Sean does not study dark matter and dark energy.\n\nFrom the fifth clue, we know that the person who studies quantum mechanics is either Dennis or Melinda. Since we already know that the person who studies dark matter and dark energy is Megan, and neither of them is named Dennis, the person who studies quantum mechanics must be Melinda.\n\nFrom the sixth clue, we know that the person who has a whiskey decanter either studies geophysics or quantum mechanics. Since we already know that Melinda studies quantum mechanics, the person who has a whiskey decanter must study geophysics.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n* Megan studies dark matter and dark energy.\n* Melinda studies quantum mechanics.\n* The person who has a whiskey decanter studies geophysics. This must be Dennis, because we already know that Sean does not study geophysics (from the third clue).\n* The person with the Victorian dollhouse is not Dennis (from the second clue), and not Megan (because she studies dark matter and dark energy), so it must be Sean.\n* The person with embellished mirrors is not Sean (from the third clue), and not Melinda (because she studies quantum mechanics), so it must be Megan.",

This means that Dennis does not study dark matter and dark energy, and the person with geophysics is not Dennis.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that of Sean and the person with a sword decoration, one studies geophysics, and the other studies quantum mechanics. This means that Sean does not study geophysics, and the person with a sword decoration does not study quantum mechanics.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that neither the person who studies dark matter and dark energy nor the one who studies quantum mechanics is named Dennis. This means that Dennis studies geophysics.\n\nFrom the fifth clue, we know that the person who studies quantum mechanics is either Dennis or Melinda. Since Dennis studies geophysics, Melinda must study quantum mechanics.\n\nFrom the sixth clue, we know that the person who has a Victorian dollhouse either studies geophysics or quantum mechanics. Since Melinda studies quantum mechanics, she must have the Victorian dollhouse.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n* Dennis studies geophysics, so he must have the whiskey decanter (from the second clue).\n* Melinda studies quantum mechanics and has the Victorian dollhouse.\n* Sean studies dark matter and dark energy (from the first clue), so he must have the sword decoration (from the third clue).\n* Megan is the only one left, so she must study dynamics and have the embellished mirrors.",
