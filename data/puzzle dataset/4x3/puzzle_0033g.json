Person A and Person B are associated with either aromatic compounds or osteoporosis, but not both.\n2. The person studying hydrocarbons is either Person A or Person C.\n3. Person D has either osteoporosis or trichotillomania.\n4. The person with Parkinson's disease is either Person A or the person studying hydrocarbons.\n5. Neither the person studying aromatic compounds nor the person studying computational chemistry has osteoporosis.\n\nFrom clue 1, we can deduce that Person A and Person B cannot both have osteoporosis, and they cannot both study aromatic compounds.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Person A or Person C studies hydrocarbons.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that Person D has either osteoporosis or trichotillomania.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that Person A or the person studying hydrocarbons has Parkinson's disease.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that the person studying aromatic compounds and the person studying computational chemistry do not have osteoporosis.\n\nNow, let's try to combine the information:\n\n* If Person A studies hydrocarbons (clue 2), then Person A cannot have Parkinson's disease (clue 4), because the person studying hydrocarbons is not the same as the person with Parkinson's disease. Therefore, Person A must study aromatic compounds (clue 1).\n* If Person A studies aromatic compounds, then Person B must have osteoporosis (clue 1).\n* Since Person B has osteoporosis, Person D cannot have osteoporosis (clue 3), so Person D must have trichotillomania.\n* Person C must study hydrocarbons (clue 2), because Person A studies aromatic compounds.\n* The person with Parkinson's disease is either Person A or the person studying hydrocarbons (clue 4). Since Person A studies aromatic compounds, the person with Parkinson's disease must be Person C, who studies hydrocarbons.\n* The person studying computational chemistry must be Person D, because the person studying aromatic compounds and the person studying computational chemistry do not have osteoporosis (clue 5), and Person B has osteoporosis.",

From the first clue, we know that Bradley or Travis has Parkinson's disease. But from the fifth clue, we know that the person who studies aromatic compounds does not have Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the person who has Parkinson's disease must be the one who does not study aromatic compounds. \n\n2. From the second clue, we know that Bradley or Stephanie studies hydrocarbons. But from the fourth clue, we know that the person who has kidney cancer is either named Bradley or studies hydrocarbons. Therefore, Bradley must study hydrocarbons, because if he had kidney cancer, the person who studies hydrocarbons would also have kidney cancer, which is not possible.\n\n3. Now we know that Bradley studies hydrocarbons. From the second clue, we know that the person who studies hydrocarbons is either Bradley or Stephanie. Therefore, Stephanie does not study hydrocarbons.\n\n4. From the third clue, we know that Carrie either has Parkinson's disease or trichotillomania. But from the first clue, we know that Bradley or Travis has Parkinson's disease. Therefore, Carrie must have trichotillomania.\n\n5. Now we know that Carrie has trichotillomania. From the third clue, we know that Carrie either has Parkinson's disease or trichotillomania. Therefore, Carrie does not have Parkinson's disease.\n\n6. From the first clue, we know that Bradley or Travis has Parkinson's disease. But from the fifth clue, we know that the person who studies aromatic compounds does not have Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the person who has Parkinson's disease must be the one who does not study aromatic compounds. \n\n7. Now we know that Bradley studies hydrocarbons. From the first clue, we know that Bradley or Travis studies aromatic compounds. Therefore, Travis must study aromatic compounds.\n\n8. From the fifth clue, we know that neither the person who studies aromatic compounds nor the one who studies computational chemistry has Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the person who studies computational chemistry must be the one who has osteoporosis.\n\n9. Now we know that Bradley studies hydrocarbons, Travis studies aromatic compounds, and Carrie has trichotillomania. From the fourth clue, we know that the person who has kidney cancer is either named Bradley or studies hydrocarbons. But Bradley studies hydrocarbons, so the person who has kidney cancer must be the one who is named Bradley.\n\n10. Now we know that Bradley has kidney cancer, Travis studies aromatic compounds, Carrie has trichotillomania, and the person who studies computational chemistry has osteoporosis. From the first clue, we know that Bradley or Travis has Parkinson's disease. But Bradley has kidney cancer, so Travis must have Parkinson's disease.\n\n11. Now we know that Bradley has kidney cancer, Travis has Parkinson's disease, Carrie has trichotillomania, and the person who studies computational chemistry has osteoporosis. From the second clue, we know that the person who studies hydrocarbons is either Bradley or Stephanie. But Bradley studies hydrocarbons, so Stephanie must study supramolecular chemistry.\n\n12. Now we know that Bradley has kidney cancer, Travis has Parkinson's disease, Carrie has trichotillomania, the person who studies computational chemistry has osteoporosis, and Stephanie studies supramolecular chemistry. From the fifth clue, we know that neither the person who studies aromatic compounds nor the one who studies computational chemistry has Parkinson's disease. Therefore, the person who studies computational chemistry must be Carrie.\n\n13. Now we know that Bradley has kidney cancer, Travis has Parkinson's disease, Carrie has osteoporosis, and Stephanie studies supramolecular chemistry. From the first clue, we know that Bradley or Travis studies aromatic compounds. But Travis has Parkinson's disease, so Bradley must study aromatic compounds.\n\n14. Now we know that Bradley has kidney cancer and studies hydrocarbons, Travis has Parkinson's disease and studies aromatic compounds, Carrie has osteoporosis and studies computational chemistry, and Stephanie studies supramolecular chemistry. From the third clue, we know that Carrie either has Parkinson's disease or trichotillomania. But Carrie has osteoporosis, so Stephanie must have trichotillomania.",

Since neither the person studying aromatic compounds nor the one studying computational chemistry has trichotillomania (clue 5), Travis must be associated with trichotillomania, and Bradley must be associated with aromatic compounds.\n\n- From clue 2, we know the person studying hydrocarbons is either Bradley or Stephanie. Since Bradley is already associated with aromatic compounds, the person studying hydrocarbons must be Stephanie.\n\n- From clue 4, we know the person with osteoporosis is either Bradley or the person studying hydrocarbons. Since Bradley is already associated with aromatic compounds, the person with osteoporosis must be the person studying hydrocarbons, which is Stephanie.\n\n- From clue 3, we know Carrie either has trichotillomania or Parkinson's disease. Since Travis is already associated with trichotillomania, Carrie must have Parkinson's disease.\n\n- The only remaining health condition is kidney cancer, which must be associated with Bradley.\n\n- The only remaining chemistry topic is computational chemistry, which must be associated with Carrie.\n\n- The only remaining person is Travis, who is associated with trichotillomania and supramolecular chemistry (the only remaining chemistry topic).",
