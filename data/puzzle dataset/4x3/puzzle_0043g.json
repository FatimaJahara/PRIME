Since Bellatrix is already taken by one of the three people mentioned in Clue 1, the person who drinks an old-fashioned must have Mira as their star.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that Person B, the person with flavored coffee, and the person with the star Bellatrix are three separate people. This confirms that Person B does not have Bellatrix as their star.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that the person with flavored coffee, the person with the star Algol, and Person D are three separate people. This means that Person D does not have flavored coffee or Algol as their star.\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that one of Person B and Person C prefers whiskey and the other has Algol as their star. Since Person B does not have Algol as their star (from Clue 3), Person C must have Algol as their star, and Person B must prefer whiskey.\n\nFrom Clue 6, we know that the person who drinks flavored coffee does not have Rigel as their star. This means that the person with flavored coffee must have either Mira or Algol as their star. But we already know that Person C has Algol as their star, so the person with flavored coffee must have Mira as their star.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n* Person B: whiskey, ?\n* Person C: ?, Algol\n* Person D: ?, ?\n\nFrom Clue 1, we know that the person who drinks pina colada is one of the three people mentioned. Since Person B and Person C already have their beverages assigned, the person who drinks pina colada must be Person A or Person D. But we know that Person D does not have flavored coffee or Algol as their star (from Clue 4), so Person D must drink pina colada.\n\n* Person A: ?, ?\n* Person B: whiskey, ?\n* Person C: ?, Algol\n* Person D: pina colada, ?\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person who drinks an old-fashioned has Mira as their star. This must be Person A, since Person B and Person C already have their stars assigned.\n\n* Person A: old-fashioned, Mira\n* Person B: whiskey, ?\n* Person C: ?, Algol\n* Person D: pina colada, ?\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that the person with flavored coffee has Bellatrix as their star. This must be Person B, since Person C already has Algol as their star.\n\n* Person A: old-fashioned, Mira\n* Person B: flavored coffee, Bellatrix\n* Person C: ?, Algol\n* Person D: pina colada, ?\n\nThe only star left is Rigel, which must belong to Person C.\n\n* Person A: old-fashioned, Mira\n* Person B: flavored coffee, Bellatrix\n* Person C: whiskey, Algol\n* Person D: pina colada, Rigel",

The person who drinks whiskey does not have Rigel as their star (Clue 6).\n\nUsing the process of elimination and combining the above deductions, we can fill in the grid as follows:\n\n- Brooke has the star Algol and drinks whiskey (Clue 4 and Clue 3).\n- Cory has the star Algol and drinks an old-fashioned (Clue 5).\n- The person who drinks flavored coffee has the star Bellatrix (Clue 1). Since Brooke and Cory already have Algol, this person must be either Douglas or Candice. But Clue 2 states that the person who drinks pina colada has either Mira or Bellatrix. Therefore, the person who drinks flavored coffee must be Candice, and she has the star Bellatrix.\n- Douglas is the only one left, and he must drink pina colada. Clue 2 states that the person who drinks pina colada has either Mira or Bellatrix, but Bellatrix is already taken by Candice. Therefore, Douglas has the star Mira.",

Since Bellatrix is already taken by one of the three people mentioned in the first clue, the person who drinks an old-fashioned must have Mira as their star.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person with flavored coffee, Cory, and the person with the star Bellatrix are three separate people. Since Cory is already mentioned in the first clue, the person with flavored coffee must be a different person.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that the person with flavored coffee, the person with the star Algol, and Brooke are three separate people. Since Brooke is not mentioned in the first clue, she must be the person with flavored coffee.\n\nFrom the fifth clue, we know that either Cory or Candice likes pina colada, and the other has Algol as their star. Since Cory is already mentioned in the first clue, Candice must have Algol as her star.\n\nFrom the sixth clue, we know that the person who drinks flavored coffee does not have Rigel as their star. Since Brooke has flavored coffee, she must have a different star.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we have:\n\n* Cory has Bellatrix as their star (from the first clue).\n* The person who drinks an old-fashioned has Mira as their star (from the second clue).\n* Brooke has flavored coffee and a star other than Rigel (from the fourth and sixth clues).\n* Candice has Algol as her star (from the fifth clue).\n* Douglas is the only person left, and he must have Rigel as his star (since the other stars are already taken).\n\nThe only beverage left for Douglas is whiskey (since the other beverages are already taken).\n\nThe only beverage left for Cory is pina colada (since the other beverages are already taken).\n\nThe only beverage left for Candice is old-fashioned (since the other beverages are already taken).\n\nThe final solution is:",
