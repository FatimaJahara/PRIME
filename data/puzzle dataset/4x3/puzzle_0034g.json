Of Person A and Person C, one is 185 cm tall, and the other has an equilateral triangle as their shape.\n3. The three people are the one with the concave polygon, the one named Person B, and the one who is 152.0 cm tall.\n4. The three people are the one with the concave polygon, the one named Person B, and the one who is 161.0 cm tall.\n5. Of Person C and the person with a cuboid shape, one is 189.0 cm tall, and the other is 161.0 cm tall.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that Person B is one of the three people, and from clue 4, we know that Person B is also one of the three people. Therefore, Person B must be the one with the concave polygon.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that either Person A or Person C is 185 cm tall, and the other has an equilateral triangle as their shape. Since Person B is already assigned to the concave polygon, Person A and Person C must be assigned to the remaining shapes.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that either Person C or the person with a cuboid shape is 189.0 cm tall, and the other is 161.0 cm tall. Since Person B is already assigned to the concave polygon, Person C must be assigned to the cuboid shape.\n\nNow, we can assign the remaining shapes and heights:\n\n* Person A: 185 cm tall, equilateral triangle\n* Person B: concave polygon, 152.0 cm tall\n* Person C: cuboid shape, 189.0 cm tall\n* Person D: ellipse, 161.0 cm tall",

Of Nathan and Kristin, one is 185.0 cm tall, and the other has an equilateral triangle as their shape.\n3. The three people are the one with the concave polygon, the one named Jeremy, and the one who is 161.0 units tall.\n4. The three people are the one with the concave polygon, the one named Jeremy, and the one who is 152.0 units tall.\n5. Of Kristin and the person with a cuboid shape, one is 189.0 units tall, and the other is 152.0 units tall.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that Brandi is not 152.0 cm tall.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Nathan and Kristin are either 185.0 cm tall or have an equilateral triangle as their shape. Since Brandi is not 152.0 cm tall, Nathan and Kristin must be the ones who are 185.0 cm tall and have an equilateral triangle as their shape, respectively.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that Jeremy, the person with the concave polygon, and the person who is 161.0 units tall are the three people. Since Jeremy is not 152.0 cm tall (from clue 4), Jeremy must be the person who is 161.0 units tall.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that Jeremy, the person with the concave polygon, and the person who is 152.0 units tall are the three people. Since Jeremy is 161.0 units tall, the person who is 152.0 units tall must be the person with the concave polygon.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that Kristin and the person with a cuboid shape are either 189.0 units tall or 152.0 units tall. Since Kristin is 185.0 cm tall (from clue 2), Kristin must be the person with the cuboid shape, and the person who is 189.0 units tall must be Brandi.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is:",

Of Nathan and Kristin, one is 152.0 units tall, and the other has an equilateral triangle as their shape.\n3. The three people are the one with the concave polygon, the one named Jeremy, and the one who is 189.0 units tall.\n4. The three people are the one with the concave polygon, the one named Jeremy, and the one who is 185.0 cm tall.\n5. Of Kristin and the person with a cuboid shape, one is 161.0 units tall, and the other is 185.0 units tall.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Nathan and Kristin have different heights and shapes. Since Nathan is not mentioned in any other clue, we can assign him the remaining height and shape: 189.0 cm and ellipse.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that Jeremy is one of the three people, and since he is not mentioned in any other clue, we can assign him the remaining height: 161.0 cm.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that the person who is 185.0 cm tall is one of the three people, and since Kristin is already assigned a height, we can assign the remaining height to Brandi: 185.0 cm.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that Kristin and the person with a cuboid shape have different heights. Since Kristin is already assigned a height, we can assign the remaining shape to her: equilateral triangle.\n\nThe remaining shape, concave polygon, can be assigned to Jeremy.\n\nThe final solution is:",
