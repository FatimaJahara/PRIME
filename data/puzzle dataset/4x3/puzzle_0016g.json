The person who is 50 years old does not like the military movie genre.\n3. The person who enjoys romantic comedy movies is either 34 or 49 years old.\n4. The three people are the one who is 50 years old, the one named Person B, and the one who likes friendship dramas.\n5. The person who enjoys friendship dramas is either Person B or Person C.\n6. Of Person D and the person who likes romantic comedy, one is 34 years old, and the other is 15 years old.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who is 50 years old likes either crime or friendship dramas. From clue 2, we know that the person who is 50 years old does not like military movies. Therefore, the person who is 50 years old must like either crime or friendship dramas, but not military.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that the person who enjoys romantic comedy movies is either 34 or 49 years old. From clue 6, we know that Person D and the person who likes romantic comedy are either 34 or 15 years old. Therefore, Person D must be 15 years old, and the person who likes romantic comedy must be 34 years old.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that the three people are the one who is 50 years old, the one named Person B, and the one who likes friendship dramas. From clue 5, we know that the person who enjoys friendship dramas is either Person B or Person C. Therefore, Person B must like friendship dramas, and the person who is 50 years old must be Person C.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who is 50 years old likes either crime or friendship dramas. Since Person C is 50 years old and Person B likes friendship dramas, Person C must like crime movies.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is:",

The person who is 50 years old does not like friendship dramas.\n3. The person who enjoys the military movie genre is either 34 or 49 years old.\n4. The three people are the one who is 50 years old, the one named Phillip, and the one who likes romantic comedies.\n5. The person who enjoys romantic comedy movies is either Phillip or Carrie.\n6. Of Stephanie and the person who likes the military movie genre, one is 34 years old, and the other is 15 years old.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that Phillip is one of the three people, and from clue 5, we know that Phillip or Carrie likes romantic comedies. Since Phillip is already one of the three people, Carrie must be the one who likes romantic comedies.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who is 50 years old likes either crime or romantic comedy. Since Carrie likes romantic comedy, the person who is 50 years old must like crime.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that the person who is 50 years old does not like friendship dramas. Therefore, the person who is 50 years old must be Mark, and Mark likes crime movies.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that the person who enjoys the military movie genre is either 34 or 49 years old. Since Stephanie is 15 years old (from clue 6), the person who enjoys the military movie genre must be either Phillip or Carrie. But Carrie likes romantic comedy, so Phillip must like military movies.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that Stephanie is 15 years old, and the person who likes the military movie genre is either 34 or 49 years old. Therefore, Phillip must be 34 years old.\n\nThe only remaining person is Stephanie, who must be 15 years old and like friendship dramas.",

The person who enjoys the crime movie genre is either Phillip or Carrie.\n6. Of Stephanie and the person who likes friendship dramas, one is 34 years old, and the other is 15 years old.\n\nLet's break down the clues step by step:\n\n- From clue 1, the 50-year-old person likes either romantic comedy or crime movies.\n- From clue 2, the 50-year-old person does not like military movies.\n- From clue 3, the person who enjoys friendship dramas is either 34 or 49 years old.\n- From clue 4, the three people are the 50-year-old, Phillip, and the one who likes crime movies.\n- From clue 5, the person who enjoys crime movies is either Phillip or Carrie.\n- From clue 6, Stephanie and the person who likes friendship dramas are either 34 or 15 years old.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- The 50-year-old person cannot like military movies (clue 2), so they must like either romantic comedy or crime movies (clue 1).\n- The person who enjoys friendship dramas is either 34 or 49 years old (clue 3).\n- Phillip and the person who likes crime movies are two of the three people (clue 4).\n- The person who enjoys crime movies is either Phillip or Carrie (clue 5).\n- Stephanie and the person who likes friendship dramas are either 34 or 15 years old (clue 6).\n\nBased on the analysis, we can start filling in the grid:\n\n- The 50-year-old person likes either romantic comedy or crime movies, but not military movies.\n- The person who enjoys friendship dramas is either 34 or 49 years old.\n- Phillip and the person who likes crime movies are two of the three people.\n- The person who enjoys crime movies is either Phillip or Carrie.\n- Stephanie and the person who likes friendship dramas are either 34 or 15 years old.\n\nAfter careful analysis and deduction, we can fill in the grid as follows:",
