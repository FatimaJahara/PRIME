Person C either uses the medley swimming stroke or the long dog paddle swimming stroke (Clue 4). Since Person B already swims the medley swimming stroke, Person C must use the long dog paddle swimming stroke.\n3. Neither Person A nor Person B has whirl stroke as their swimming stroke (Clue 5). This means Person A must use either the open water stroke or the medley swimming stroke (already taken by Person B), so Person A must use the open water stroke.\n4. The person whose name is Person B swims the medley swimming stroke (Clue 6). This means Person B cannot have the teacup set as their decoration (Clue 7). Also, Person B cannot have the faux flower arrangement as their decoration (Clue 2). Therefore, Person B must have the cowhide rug as their decoration.\n5. Of Person B and the person who uses the long dog paddle, one has a steering wheel, and the other has a faux flower arrangement as their decoration (Clue 3). Since Person B has the cowhide rug, the person who uses the long dog paddle (Person C) must have the faux flower arrangement as their decoration.\n6. Neither Person C nor Person D has a teacup set as their decoration (Clue 1). This means Person A or Person B must have the teacup set as their decoration. Since Person B already has the cowhide rug, Person A must have the teacup set as their decoration.\n7. Person D is the only one left, and the only decoration left is the steering wheel. Therefore, Person D must have the steering wheel as their decoration.\n8. The only swimming stroke left is the whirl stroke, which must be assigned to Person D.",

Neither Erik nor Crystal has a faux flower arrangement as their decoration.\n3. Of Erik and the person who uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke, one has a cowhide rug, and the other has a faux flower arrangement as their decoration.\n4. Rachel either uses the medley swimming stroke or the long dog paddle.\n5. Neither Shane nor Erik has whirl stroke as their swimming stroke.\n6. The person whose name is Erik prefers medley swimming.\n7. Neither the person who swims the long dog paddle nor the one who swims the whirl stroke has a steering wheel as their decoration.\n\nLet's break down the clues step by step:\n\n- From clue 6, we know Erik prefers medley swimming.\n- From clue 4, Rachel either uses the medley swimming stroke or the long dog paddle. Since Erik already has medley swimming, Rachel must use the long dog paddle.\n- From clue 3, we know that Erik and the person who uses the long dog paddle (Rachel) have either a cowhide rug or a faux flower arrangement. Since Erik can't have a faux flower arrangement (clue 2), he must have the cowhide rug, and Rachel must have the faux flower arrangement.\n- From clue 1, neither Rachel nor Crystal has a steering wheel. Since Rachel already has a faux flower arrangement, Crystal must have the teacup set (the only remaining decoration).\n- From clue 5, neither Shane nor Erik has whirl stroke. Since Erik already has medley swimming, Shane must have the whirl stroke.\n- From clue 7, neither the person who swims the long dog paddle (Rachel) nor the one who swims the whirl stroke (Shane) has a steering wheel. This means Crystal must have the steering wheel.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid:",

Neither Erik nor Crystal has a steering wheel as their decoration.\n3. Of Erik and the person who uses the long dog paddle swimming stroke, one has a teacup set, and the other has a steering wheel as their decoration.\n4. Rachel either uses the medley swimming stroke or the long dog paddle.\n5. Neither Shane nor Erik has whirl stroke as their swimming stroke.\n6. The person whose name is Erik prefers medley swimming.\n7. Neither the person who swims the long dog paddle nor the one who swims the whirl stroke has a faux flower arrangement as their decoration.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know Erik prefers medley swimming. From clue 4, we know Rachel either uses the medley swimming stroke or the long dog paddle. Since Erik already has medley swimming, Rachel must use the long dog paddle.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that Erik and the person who uses the long dog paddle (Rachel) have either a teacup set or a steering wheel as their decoration. Since Erik can't have a steering wheel (clue 2), he must have a teacup set. Rachel must have a steering wheel.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know neither Rachel nor Crystal has a faux flower arrangement. From clue 7, we know neither the person who swims the long dog paddle (Rachel) nor the one who swims the whirl stroke has a faux flower arrangement. This means Shane must have the faux flower arrangement.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know neither Shane nor Erik has whirl stroke. Since Rachel has the long dog paddle, and Erik has medley swimming, Crystal must have whirl stroke.\n\nThe only decoration left is the cowhide rug, which must belong to Crystal.",
