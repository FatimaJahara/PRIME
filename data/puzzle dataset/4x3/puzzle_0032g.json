From the first clue, we know that the person who dresses up as a fairy is either Person A or Person D. Let's assume it's Person A. Then, from the third clue, we know that Person B is dressed as a construction worker.\n\n2. From the second clue, we know that the person who uses butter is not Person C. Let's assume it's Person B. Then, from the third clue, we know that Person B is dressed as a construction worker, which contradicts our assumption in step 1. Therefore, our assumption in step 1 is incorrect, and the person who dresses up as a fairy is Person D.\n\n3. From the sixth clue, we know that one of Person D and the person who uses butter is dressed as a fairy, and the other is dressed as a sunflower. Since Person D is dressed as a fairy, the person who uses butter is dressed as a sunflower. From the second clue, we know that the person who uses butter is not Person C. Therefore, the person who uses butter is Person A, and Person A is dressed as a sunflower.\n\n4. From the fourth clue, we know that the person who uses powdered gelatin is either Person A or Person C. Since Person A uses butter, the person who uses powdered gelatin is Person C.\n\n5. From the fifth clue, we know that the person who bakes with poppy seeds either dresses up as a construction worker or is Person C. Since Person C uses powdered gelatin, the person who bakes with poppy seeds dresses up as a construction worker. From the third clue, we know that Person B is dressed as a construction worker. Therefore, Person B bakes with poppy seeds.\n\n6. The only remaining person is Person B, who is dressed as a construction worker and bakes with poppy seeds. The only remaining costume is Harry Potter, which must be worn by Person C.",

                    "reasoning": "From the given clues, we can start by analyzing the information provided.\n\n1. The person who dresses up as Harry Potter for Halloween is either Donald or Stacy.\n2. The person who uses butter as a baking ingredient is not named Misty.\n3. Of George and the person who uses butter as a baking ingredient, one is dressed as Harry Potter, and the other is dressed as a construction worker for Halloween.\n4. The person who uses powdered gelatin as a baking ingredient is either named Donald or Misty.\n5. The person who bakes with poppy seeds is either someone named Misty or someone who dresses up as a construction worker for Halloween.\n6. Of Stacy and the person who uses butter as a baking ingredient, one is dressed as Harry Potter, and the other is dressed as a fairy for Halloween.\n\nLet's break down the clues step by step:\n\n- From clue 1, we know that either Donald or Stacy dresses up as Harry Potter.\n- From clue 2, we know that the person who uses butter is not Misty.\n- From clue 3, we know that George and the person who uses butter are dressed as Harry Potter and a construction worker, respectively, or vice versa.\n- From clue 4, we know that the person who uses powdered gelatin is either Donald or Misty.\n- From clue 5, we know that the person who bakes with poppy seeds is either Misty or someone who dresses up as a construction worker.\n- From clue 6, we know that Stacy and the person who uses butter are dressed as Harry Potter and a fairy, respectively, or vice versa.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Donald dresses up as Harry Potter (clue 1), then Stacy cannot use butter (clue 6), and George must use butter (clue 3). But then, Misty cannot use powdered gelatin (clue 4), which means Donald must use powdered gelatin. However, this contradicts clue 4, which states that the person who uses powdered gelatin is either Donald or Misty. Therefore, Donald cannot dress up as Harry Potter.\n- If Stacy dresses up as Harry Potter (clue 1), then Donald must use butter (clue 6), and George must dress up as a construction worker (clue 3). Misty cannot use butter (clue 2), so she must use either poppy seeds or powdered gelatin. But if Misty uses powdered gelatin, then Donald cannot use it (clue 4), which means Donald must use oil. However, this leaves no option for George, who must use either butter or poppy seeds. Therefore, Misty must use poppy seeds, and George must use butter.\n- Now, we know that Stacy dresses up as Harry Potter, Donald uses butter, George dresses up as a construction worker, and Misty uses poppy seeds. The only remaining option for Donald's Halloween costume is the fairy, and the only remaining option for Misty's Halloween costume is the sunflower.",

                    "reasoning": "From the first clue, we know that either Donald or Stacy dresses up as a sunflower for Halloween.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that the person who uses butter as a baking ingredient is not named Misty.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that one of George and the person who uses butter as a baking ingredient is dressed as a sunflower, and the other is dressed as a fairy for Halloween.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that the person who uses powdered gelatin as a baking ingredient is either named Donald or Misty.\n\nFrom the fifth clue, we know that the person who bakes with poppy seeds is either someone who dresses up as a fairy for Halloween or is named Misty.\n\nFrom the sixth clue, we know that one of Stacy and the person who uses butter as a baking ingredient is dressed as a sunflower, and the other is dressed as a construction worker for Halloween.\n\nNow, let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\n1. From the first clue, we know that either Donald or Stacy dresses up as a sunflower for Halloween. Let's assume Donald dresses up as a sunflower. Then, from the third clue, we know that George is dressed as a fairy for Halloween.\n\n2. From the second clue, we know that the person who uses butter as a baking ingredient is not named Misty. Let's assume George uses butter as a baking ingredient. Then, from the third clue, we know that George is dressed as a fairy for Halloween, which contradicts our assumption in step 1. Therefore, our assumption in step 1 is incorrect, and Stacy dresses up as a sunflower for Halloween.\n\n3. From the sixth clue, we know that one of Stacy and the person who uses butter as a baking ingredient is dressed as a sunflower, and the other is dressed as a construction worker for Halloween. Since Stacy dresses up as a sunflower, the person who uses butter as a baking ingredient is dressed as a construction worker. Let's assume Donald uses butter as a baking ingredient. Then, Donald is dressed as a construction worker.\n\n4. From the fourth clue, we know that the person who uses powdered gelatin as a baking ingredient is either named Donald or Misty. Since Donald uses butter as a baking ingredient, Misty uses powdered gelatin as a baking ingredient.\n\n5. From the fifth clue, we know that the person who bakes with poppy seeds is either someone who dresses up as a fairy for Halloween or is named Misty. Since Misty uses powdered gelatin as a baking ingredient, the person who bakes with poppy seeds is someone who dresses up as a fairy for Halloween. From the third clue, we know that George is dressed as a fairy for Halloween. Therefore, George bakes with poppy seeds.\n\n6. The only remaining person is George, who is dressed as a fairy for Halloween and bakes with poppy seeds. The only remaining baking ingredient is oil, which must be used by George.\n\n7. The only remaining Halloween costume is Harry Potter, which must be used by Misty.",
