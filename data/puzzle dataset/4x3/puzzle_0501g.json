Neither the person with a bold personality nor the one with a nurturing personality uses a cargo plane or the train as their transportation mode. This means that the person with a bold personality and the person with a nurturing personality must use either a motorcycle or a jet ski.\n\n2. The person who uses a motorcycle as their transportation mode has a personality that is either bold or nurturing. This means that the person with a bold personality or the person with a nurturing personality must use a motorcycle.\n\n3. The person who has a gentle personality either is Person B or uses the train as their transportation mode. This means that Person B must have a gentle personality, and the person who uses the train must have a strategic personality.\n\n4. Neither Person A nor Person C uses the train as their transportation mode. This means that Person D must use the train.\n\n5. Of Person B and the person who uses a motorcycle, one has a bold personality, and the other has a gentle personality. This means that Person B has a gentle personality, and the person who uses a motorcycle has a bold personality.\n\n6. Of Person A and the person who is strategic, one uses a motorcycle, and the other uses a train. This means that Person A uses a motorcycle, and the person who is strategic uses a train.\n\n7. Neither the person who uses a motorcycle nor the one who uses a train is Person C. This means that Person C must use a jet ski.\n\nBased on these deductions, we can fill in the grid as follows:",

Neither the person with a strategic personality nor the one with a nurturing personality uses a cargo plane or the train as their transportation mode. This means that the person with a strategic personality and the person with a nurturing personality must use either a motorcycle or a jet ski.\n\n2. The person who uses a motorcycle as their transportation mode is either strategic or nurturing. This means that the person who uses a motorcycle cannot have a bold or gentle personality.\n\n3. The person with a bold personality either has the name Jeffrey or uses the train as their transportation mode. Since neither Bradley nor Kathryn has the train as their transportation mode, Jeffrey must have the train as his transportation mode.\n\n4. Of Jeffrey and the person who uses a motorcycle, one has a strategic personality, and the other has a bold personality. Since Jeffrey has the train as his transportation mode, he cannot have a strategic personality. Therefore, the person who uses a motorcycle must have a strategic personality.\n\n5. Of Bradley and the person who is gentle, one uses a motorcycle, and the other uses a train. Since the person who uses a motorcycle has a strategic personality, Bradley must be gentle and use the train.\n\n6. Neither the person who uses a motorcycle nor the one who uses a train is named Kathryn. This means that Kathryn must use either a cargo plane or a jet ski.\n\n7. Since Kathryn cannot use the train, and Bradley is gentle and uses the train, Kathryn must use a cargo plane.\n\n8. Mary is the only person left, and she must use a jet ski. Since the person who uses a motorcycle has a strategic personality, Mary must have a nurturing personality.",

The person with a nurturing personality and the person with a strategic personality do not use a cargo plane or a train as their transportation mode. (Clue 1 and Clue 2)\n2. The person who uses a motorcycle as their transportation mode is either a nurturing or a strategic person. (Clue 3)\n3. The person with a gentle personality either has the name Jeffrey or uses the train as their transportation mode. (Clue 4)\n4. Neither Bradley nor Kathryn has a train as their transportation mode. (Clue 5)\n5. Of Jeffrey and the person who uses a motorcycle, one has a nurturing personality, and the other has a gentle personality. (Clue 6)\n6. Of Bradley and the person with a bold personality, one uses a motorcycle, and the other uses a train. (Clue 7)\n7. Neither the motorcycle rider nor the train rider is Kathryn. (Clue 8)\n\nUsing these clues, we can start by assigning the transportation modes:\n\n* Since the person with a nurturing personality and the person with a strategic personality do not use a cargo plane or a train, they must use either a motorcycle or a jet ski. (Clue 1 and Clue 2)\n* The person who uses a motorcycle is either a nurturing or a strategic person. (Clue 3)\n* Since Jeffrey and the person who uses a motorcycle have different personalities (nurturing and gentle), and the person with a gentle personality either has the name Jeffrey or uses the train, Jeffrey must use the motorcycle. (Clue 6)\n* Bradley and the person with a bold personality use either a motorcycle or a train, but since Jeffrey already uses the motorcycle, Bradley must use the train. (Clue 7)\n* Kathryn does not use a train (Clue 5), so she must use either a cargo plane or a jet ski.\n* Mary is the only one left, and she must use the remaining transportation mode, which is the cargo plane.\n\nNow we can assign the personalities:\n\n* Jeffrey uses a motorcycle and has a gentle personality. (Clue 6)\n* Bradley uses a train and has a bold personality. (Clue 7)\n* Kathryn uses either a cargo plane or a jet ski, and since she is not nurturing or strategic (Clue 1 and Clue 2), she must have a gentle personality.\n* Mary uses a cargo plane and has a nurturing personality.",
