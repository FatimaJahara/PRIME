The person who dresses up as Sleeping Beauty for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza.\n3. Person B does not dress up as a mafia boss for Halloween.\n4. Neither the person dressed as a ladybug nor the one dressed as a mafia boss is Person B.\n5. The person whose Halloween costume is a construction worker does not like carnivore pizza.\n6. The person who dresses up as a mafia boss for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza.\n7. Of Person B and Person D, one is dressed as a construction worker for Halloween, and the other prefers carnivore pizza.\n8. The three people are the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza, the one named Person B, and the one dressed as a mafia boss.\n9. The person who dresses up as Sleeping Beauty for Halloween is either Person C or someone who likes carnivore pizza.\n\nUsing the process of elimination and logical deduction, we can start filling in the grid.\n\nFrom clue 7, we know that either Person B or Person D is dressed as a construction worker, and the other prefers carnivore pizza. Since Person B does not dress up as a mafia boss (clue 3), Person D must be dressed as a construction worker, and Person B prefers carnivore pizza.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that the person whose Halloween costume is a construction worker does not like carnivore pizza. Therefore, Person D's pizza preference is not carnivore pizza.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who likes salami and olive pizza is not Person D. Therefore, Person D's pizza preference is either clam pizza, basil pesto chicken pizza, or carnivore pizza (already eliminated).\n\nFrom clue 8, we know that the three people are the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza, the one named Person B, and the one dressed as a mafia boss. Since Person B prefers carnivore pizza, the person with the basil pesto chicken pizza must be either Person A or Person C.\n\nFrom clue 9, we know that the person who dresses up as Sleeping Beauty for Halloween is either Person C or someone who likes carnivore pizza. Since Person B prefers carnivore pizza, the person who dresses up as Sleeping Beauty must be Person C.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that the person who dresses up as Sleeping Beauty for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza. Since Person C dresses up as Sleeping Beauty, Person C's pizza preference is either clam pizza or carnivore pizza.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that the person who dresses up as a mafia boss for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza. Since Person C dresses up as Sleeping Beauty, the person who dresses up as a mafia boss must be either Person A or Person D.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that neither the person dressed as a ladybug nor the one dressed as a mafia boss is Person B. Therefore, Person A must be dressed as a ladybug.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that Person B does not dress up as a mafia boss for Halloween. Therefore, Person D must be dressed as a mafia boss.\n\nNow we can fill in the grid:",

Neither the person dressed as a construction worker nor the one dressed as a ladybug is named Donald.\n5. The person whose Halloween costume is a mafia boss does not like carnivore pizza.\n6. The person who dresses up as a ladybug for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza.\n7.

The three people are the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza, the one named Donald, and the one with the ladybug Halloween costume.\n9. The person who dresses up as Sleeping Beauty for Halloween is either named Kristin or likes carnivore pizza.\n\nLet's break down the information:\n\n- From clue 1, we know Kristen does not like salami and olive pizza.\n- From clue 2, we know Sleeping Beauty likes either clam or carnivore pizza.\n- From clue 3, we know Donald does not have a ladybug costume.\n- From clue 4, we know Donald is not a construction worker or a ladybug.\n- From clue 5, we know the mafia boss does not like carnivore pizza.\n- From clue 6, we know the ladybug likes either clam or carnivore pizza.\n- From clue 7, we know Donald or Kristen is the mafia boss, and the other likes carnivore pizza.\n- From clue 8, we know the three people are Donald, the ladybug, and the basil pesto chicken pizza.\n- From clue 9, we know Sleeping Beauty is either Kristin or likes carnivore pizza.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information:\n\n- Since Kristen does not like salami and olive pizza (clue 1), and the mafia boss does not like carnivore pizza (clue 5), Kristen must be the mafia boss (because Donald or Kristen is the mafia boss, and the other likes carnivore pizza, clue 7).\n- Since Kristen is the mafia boss, Donald likes carnivore pizza (clue 7).\n- Since Donald likes carnivore pizza, and the ladybug likes either clam or carnivore pizza (clue 6), the ladybug must like clam pizza (because Donald already likes carnivore pizza).\n- Since the ladybug likes clam pizza, and the person who dresses up as Sleeping Beauty for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza (clue 2), Sleeping Beauty must like carnivore pizza (because the ladybug already likes clam pizza).\n- Since Sleeping Beauty likes carnivore pizza, and the person who dresses up as Sleeping Beauty for Halloween is either named Kristin or likes carnivore pizza (clue 9), Kristin must be Sleeping Beauty (because Donald already likes carnivore pizza).\n- Since Kristin is Sleeping Beauty, and the three people are the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza, the one named Donald, and the one with the ladybug Halloween costume (clue 8), Brent must be the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza.\n- Since Brent is the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza, and the person who dresses up as a construction worker is not named Donald (clue 4), Brent must be the construction worker.",

The person who dresses up as a construction worker for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza.\n3. Donald does not have a mafia boss Halloween costume.\n4. Neither the person dressed as Sleeping Beauty nor the one dressed as a mafia boss is named Donald.\n5. The person whose Halloween costume is a ladybug does not like carnivore pizza.\n6. The person who dresses up as a mafia boss for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza.\n7. Of Donald and Kristen, one dresses up as a ladybug for Halloween, and the other prefers carnivore pizza.\n8. The three people are the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza, the one named Donald, and the one with the mafia boss Halloween costume.\n9. The person who dresses up as a construction worker for Halloween is either named Kristin or likes carnivore pizza.\n\nFrom clue 7, we know that Donald and Kristen are associated with either the ladybug costume or carnivore pizza. Since Donald does not have a mafia boss costume (clue 3), he must be associated with the ladybug costume or carnivore pizza. Kristen cannot be associated with salami and olive pizza (clue 1), so she must be associated with either clam pizza or carnivore pizza.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that the person who dresses up as a construction worker for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza. Since Kristen is associated with either clam pizza or carnivore pizza, she must be the one who dresses up as a construction worker for Halloween.\n\nFrom clue 9, we know that the person who dresses up as a construction worker for Halloween is either named Kristin or likes carnivore pizza. Since Kristen is already associated with the construction worker costume, Kristin must be the one who likes carnivore pizza.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that the person who dresses up as a mafia boss for Halloween either likes clam pizza or carnivore pizza. Since Kristin likes carnivore pizza, the person who dresses up as a mafia boss for Halloween must like clam pizza.\n\nFrom clue 8, we know that the three people are the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza, the one named Donald, and the one with the mafia boss Halloween costume. Since Donald is associated with the ladybug costume, he must be the one with the basil pesto chicken pizza.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that the person whose Halloween costume is a ladybug does not like carnivore pizza. Since Donald is associated with the ladybug costume, he must like basil pesto chicken pizza.\n\nThe only remaining person is Brent, who must be associated with the sleeping beauty costume and salami and olive pizza.",
