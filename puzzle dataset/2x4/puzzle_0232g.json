Of Person A and the person who has a pool, one has protein shakes, and the other has mimosa as their beverage (Clue 1).\n\nFrom Clue 2 and Clue 3, we can conclude that Person B has variegated leaves and a pool.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that the person who has a pool (Person B) either has deltoid leaves or drinks mimosa. But since Person B already has variegated leaves, they cannot have deltoid leaves. Therefore, Person B must drink mimosa.\n\nNow, from Clue 1, we know that Person A and the person who has a pool (Person B) have different beverages. Since Person B drinks mimosa, Person A must have protein shakes.\n\nThe only category left is the type of leaves for Person A.

Since Stacey has a pool and variegated leaves, she cannot have deltoid leaves.
