Therefore, Lauren cannot like pollock.\n* If Shaun likes pollock, then he must drive a Mercedes-AMG G63 (from the second clue). But then, he would have \"M\" as his favorite letter (from the third clue), which means Lauren would have \"a\" as her favorite letter (since Shaun has \"m\"). This is consistent with the first clue.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n* Shaun likes pollock and drives a Mercedes-AMG G63.\n* Lauren likes angelfish and has \"a\" as her favorite letter.\n\nThe only remaining option for Lauren's car is the Mini Cooper.",

But then Lauren would have to like pollock, which would mean she either drives a Mini Cooper or has \"m\" as her favorite letter. However, this would contradict the fact that the person who owns a Mini Cooper has \"m\" as their favorite letter. Therefore, Shaun cannot like angelfish.\n* If Lauren likes angelfish, then she owns a Mini Cooper and has \"m\" as her favorite letter. This means Shaun likes pollock and drives a Mercedes-AMG G63.
