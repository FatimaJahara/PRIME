Since felt fabric is already associated with lung cancer, clue 1 tells us that the person with felt fabric cannot have slate rocks (because they either have slate rocks or migraines, and we already know they have lung cancer). Therefore, the person with felt fabric must have gneiss rocks.\n\nNow, let's look at clue 3. It tells us that the person who prefers felt fabric either has the name Donald or suffers from migraines. We already know that the person with felt fabric has lung cancer, so they cannot have migraines (because each person can only have one health condition). Therefore, the person with felt fabric must be Donald.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\n* Donald: felt fabric, gneiss rocks, lung cancer\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining options. We know that Misty cannot have felt fabric (because Donald already has it), so Misty must have gauze fabric. We also know that Misty cannot have lung cancer (because Donald already has it), so Misty must have migraines. Finally, we know that Misty cannot have gneiss rocks (because Donald already has them), so Misty must have slate rocks.\n\nTherefore, the final solution is:",
