Of the person with the great horned owl and the one with a porcelain figurine, one has elliptical leaves, and the other has green leaves.\n4. The person whose name is Person A has elliptical leaves.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that Person A has elliptical leaves. From clue 1, we know that the person with the great horned owl has either elliptical leaves or green leaves. Since Person A already has elliptical leaves, the person with the great horned owl must have green leaves.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Person B and the person with an electric guitar have different birds. Since the person with the great horned owl has green leaves, and Person A has elliptical leaves, Person B must have the flightless bird.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that the person with the great horned owl and the one with a porcelain figurine have different types of leaves. Since the person with the great horned owl has green leaves, the person with a porcelain figurine must have elliptical leaves. But we already know that Person A has elliptical leaves, so the person with a porcelain figurine must be Person A.\n\nNow we can fill in the grid:",
