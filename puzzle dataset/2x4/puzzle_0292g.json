But then, Person A cannot have the galapagos tortoise (since Person A is associated with the rivulet), which means Person B must have the galapagos tortoise. This contradicts the third clue, so this possibility is ruled out.\n* If Person B has the sound system, then Person A must have the angonoka reptile. Since Person B has the kitchen gadget, Person A must have the sound system. Now, Person A cannot have the galapagos tortoise (since Person A is associated with the rivulet), which means Person B must have the galapagos tortoise. This satisfies all the clues.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:",
