One has Pellucidar and the other has American Hunter.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who likes siltstone does not have Hogwarts as their fictional world.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Person A has Pellucidar, then Person B has American Hunter (from clue 2). But then, Person B cannot have siltstone (from clue 1), so Person A must have siltstone. But then, Person A cannot have Hogwarts (from clue 3), so Person A must have Pellucidar and siltstone, and Person B must have American Hunter and sandstone.\n* If Person B has Pellucidar, then Person A has American Hunter (from clue 2). But then, Person A cannot have siltstone (from clue 1), so Person B must have siltstone. But then, Person B cannot have Hogwarts (from clue 3), so Person B must have Pellucidar and siltstone, and Person A must have American Hunter and sandstone.\n\nIn both cases, we get the same solution:",
