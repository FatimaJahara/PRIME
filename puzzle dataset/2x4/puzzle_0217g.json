From the first clue, we can conclude that Person A's favourite movie is not The Warriors (because if it were, then Person B's favourite movie would be Clueless, which is not possible according to the first clue). Therefore, Person A's favourite movie is Clueless.\n\n2. From the second clue, we know that the person who has caramel apple pie and the one who has triticale have different favourite movies. Since Person A's favourite movie is Clueless, the person who has triticale must have The Warriors as their favourite movie.\n\n3. From the third clue, we know that the person who eats flax grains either has the name Person A or eats water pie. Since Person A's favourite movie is Clueless, and the person who has triticale has The Warriors as their favourite movie, Person A must eat flax grains (because if Person A ate triticale, then they would have The Warriors as their favourite movie, which is not possible).\n\n4. From the fourth clue, we know that the person whose favourite movie is Clueless is either Person A or someone who eats triticale. Since Person A's favourite movie is Clueless, and Person A eats flax grains, the person who eats triticale must have The Warriors as their favourite movie.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid:\n\n```\n{\n    \"Person A\": {\n        \"Favourite Movie\": \"Clueless\",\n        \"Types of Grains\": \"flax\",\n        \"Types of Pies\": \"water pie\"\n    },\n    \"Person B\": {\n        \"Favourite Movie\": \"The Warriors\",\n        \"Types of Grains\": \"triticale\",\n        \"Types of Pies\": \"caramel apple pie\"\n    }\n}\n```",
