Since Person A is already assigned to a wind vane, they must have one of these two options.\n\nThe fourth clue states that of the person with a wind vane (Person A) and the one with mollisol soil, one prefers a jewelry box, and the other prefers a drone camera. This means that Person A cannot have mollisol soil, as they would then prefer a drone camera, which contradicts the third clue. Therefore, Person A must have a preference for jewelry boxes.\n\nNow, we can assign the remaining options to Person B. Since Person B uses a spectrophotometer, they must have mollisol soil (as Person A has jewelry boxes). The only remaining option for Person B's shopping preference is a drone camera.",

Therefore, Matthew must have a preference for drone cameras.\n\nNow, let's look at Lori.
