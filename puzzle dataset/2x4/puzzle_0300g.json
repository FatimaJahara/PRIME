Since we already know that the person born in February has bronchi, this means that the person who reads Working Mother must have a spinal cord as their associated organ.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that of Person A and the person with a spinal cord, one's favourite magazine is Model Railroader, and the other's is Working Mother. Since we already know that the person who reads Working Mother has a spinal cord, this means that Person A must have Model Railroader as their favourite magazine.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we know so far:\n\n* The person born in February has bronchi as their associated organ.\n* The person who reads Working Mother has a spinal cord as their associated organ.\n* Person A has Model Railroader as their favourite magazine.\n\nSince Person A has Model Railroader as their favourite magazine, and the person who reads Working Mother has a spinal cord, Person A must not be the person who reads Working Mother. Therefore, Person B must be the person who reads Working Mother.\n\nAlso, since the person born in February has bronchi, and Person A has Model Railroader, Person A must not be the person born in February. Therefore, Person B must be the person born in February.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we know:\n\n* Person A has Model Railroader as their favourite magazine and is not born in February.\n* Person B has Working Mother as their favourite magazine, is born in February, and has a spinal cord as their associated organ.\n\nThe only remaining category is the birth month for Person A.
