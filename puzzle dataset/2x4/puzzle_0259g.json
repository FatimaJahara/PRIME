The person who owns the trivia book \"The Top 10 of Everything\" either has Mad Max: Fury Road as their favourite movie or prefers durum wheat.\n   - This means that the person who owns \"The Top 10 of Everything\" cannot have Mean Girls as their favourite movie and grain as their type of grain.\n\n2. The person who prefers durum wheat either reads The Trivia Encyclopedia or likes the movie Mean Girls.\n   - This means that the person who prefers durum wheat cannot have \"The Top 10 of Everything\" as their trivia book and Mad Max: Fury Road as their favourite movie.\n\n3. The person whose name is Stacey has durum wheat as their type of grain.\n   - This means that Stacey must have either \"The Trivia Encyclopedia\" as her trivia book or Mean Girls as her favourite movie.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n- If Stacey has \"The Trivia Encyclopedia\" as her trivia book, then she must have Mean Girls as her favourite movie (from clue 2). But then, Matthew would have to have \"The Top 10 of Everything\" as his trivia book, which would mean he has Mad Max: Fury Road as his favourite movie (from clue 1). This would leave grain as the only option for Matthew's type of grain.\n\n- If Stacey has Mean Girls as her favourite movie, then she must have \"The Trivia Encyclopedia\" as her trivia book (from clue 2). But then, Matthew would have to have \"The Top 10 of Everything\" as his trivia book, which would mean he has durum wheat as his type of grain (from clue 1). This would leave Mad Max: Fury Road as the only option for Matthew's favourite movie.\n\nIn both cases, we get the same solution:",
