Since Person A has Uranus as their planet, the person whose flower is florist must have K2-18b as their planet. This means that Person B has florist as their flower.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that the person who has a mounted axe decoration either has a poinsettia or a florist flower. Since Person B has florist as their flower, Person B cannot have a mounted axe decoration. Therefore, Person A must have a mounted axe decoration.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who has poinsettia as their flower either has Uranus as their planet or has a mounted axe as their decoration.
