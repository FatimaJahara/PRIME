Therefore, Person B's DC Comic Character is Poison Ivy.\n* Person A has a shopping preference that is not a jewelry box (since Person B has a jewelry box). Therefore, Person A's shopping preference is a gaming headset.\n* Person A has a DC Comic Character that is not Poison Ivy (since Person B has Poison Ivy). Therefore, Person A's DC Comic Character is Birds of Prey.\n* The person with autonomous resupply vehicles has a DC Comic Character that is not Birds of Prey (since Person B and the person with autonomous resupply vehicles have different DC Comic Characters).
