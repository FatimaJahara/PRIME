This means that the person who likes surfing must have cauliflower puree as baby food.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who surfs either has the name Jason or has succulents as their type of plants. Since we already know that the person who surfs has cauliflower puree as baby food, and Sarah cannot have desert plants (from the first clue), it must be Jason who surfs and has succulents as his type of plants.\n\nNow we can fill in the grid:",

                    "reasoning": "From the first clue, we know that Sarah and the person who has desert plants have different baby foods, one has cauliflower puree and the other has pear mash. This means that Sarah cannot have desert plants, because if she did, she would have to have one of the baby foods, but the clue states that the person with desert plants has the other baby food.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that the person who likes aerobics does not have pear mash as baby food. This means that the person who likes aerobics must have cauliflower puree as baby food.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who participates in aerobics either has the name Jason or has succulents as their type of plants. Since we already know that the person who likes aerobics has cauliflower puree as baby food, we can conclude that Jason must have cauliflower puree as baby food, and therefore Sarah must have pear mash as baby food.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n```\n{\n    \"jason\": {\n        \"Sports\": \"?\",\n        \"Types of Plants\": \"?\",\n        \"Baby Food\": \"cauliflower puree\"\n    },\n    \"sarah\": {\n        \"Sports\": \"?\",\n        \"Types of Plants\": \"?\",\n        \"Baby Food\": \"pear mash\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFrom the first clue, we know that Sarah and the person who has desert plants have different baby foods. Since Sarah has pear mash, the person who has desert plants must have cauliflower puree, which is Jason. Therefore, Jason must have desert plants.\n\n```\n{\n    \"jason\": {\n        \"Sports\": \"?\",\n        \"Types of Plants\": \"desert plants\",\n        \"Baby Food\": \"cauliflower puree\"\n    },\n    \"sarah\": {\n        \"Sports\": \"?\",\n        \"Types of Plants\": \"?\",\n        \"Baby Food\": \"pear mash\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who participates in aerobics either has the name Jason or has succulents as their type of plants. Since Jason has desert plants, the person who participates in aerobics must have succulents. But we already know that Jason has cauliflower puree as baby food, so the person who participates in aerobics must be Sarah. Therefore, Sarah must have succulents.\n\n```\n{\n    \"jason\": {\n        \"Sports\": \"?\",\n        \"Types of Plants\": \"desert plants\",\n        \"Baby Food\": \"cauliflower puree\"\n    },\n    \"sarah\": {\n        \"Sports\": \"aerobics\",\n        \"Types of Plants\": \"succulents\",\n        \"Baby Food\": \"pear mash\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we can conclude that Jason must have surfing as his sport, since Sarah has aerobics.\n\n```\n{\n    \"jason\": {\n        \"Sports\": \"surfing\",\n        \"Types of Plants\": \"desert plants\",\n        \"Baby Food\": \"cauliflower puree\"\n    },\n    \"sarah\": {\n        \"Sports\": \"aerobics\",\n        \"Types of Plants\": \"succulents\",\n        \"Baby Food\": \"pear mash\"\n    }\n}\n```",
