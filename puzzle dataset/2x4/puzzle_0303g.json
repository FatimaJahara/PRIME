But then, Person A would have to live on a freeway (since Person B lives on a service road, according to the first clue). However, this would mean that Person A has both a Boeing 747 freighter and lives on a freeway, which contradicts the second clue.\n\n- Therefore, Person B must have a Boeing 747 freighter. This means that Person A has Sons of Anarchy as their favourite TV show.\n\n- Since Person B has a Boeing 747 freighter, they must live on a freeway (according to the second clue). This means that Person A lives on a service road.\n\n- Finally, since Person A lives on a service road, their favourite TV show must be Say Yes to the Dress (according to the first clue).",
