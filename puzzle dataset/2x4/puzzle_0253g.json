Of Person A and the person who studies aldehydes and ketones, one drinks protein shakes, and the other drinks milkshakes.\n5. Of Person A and Person B, one drinks protein shakes and the other is associated with a subgiant star.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that Person B is associated with either luminous blue variable stars or subgiant stars.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that the person who drinks protein shakes is either Person A or studies aldehydes and ketones. This means that Person B cannot drink protein shakes, as they are associated with either luminous blue variable stars or subgiant stars.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that the person who drinks milkshakes is either interested in luminous blue variable stars or is Person B. This means that Person A cannot drink milkshakes, as they are not associated with luminous blue variable stars.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that one of Person A and the person who studies aldehydes and ketones drinks protein shakes, and the other drinks milkshakes. Since Person A cannot drink milkshakes, they must drink protein shakes. Therefore, the person who studies aldehydes and ketones must drink milkshakes.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that one of Person A and Person B drinks protein shakes, and the other is associated with a subgiant star. Since Person A drinks protein shakes, Person B must be associated with a subgiant star.\n\nNow, we can fill in the grid:",
