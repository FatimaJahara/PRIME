This means James must have a budgeriga as a pet.\n* If Heather plays the contrabass, then she must have tomahawk throwing as her hobby (since James cannot have sewing as his hobby). But this contradicts clue 3, which states that Heather likes sewing.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that James plays the contrabass and has tomahawk throwing as his hobby. Heather likes sewing, and since she cannot play the contrabass (as concluded above), she must play the bagpipe.\n\nNow, let's assign the pets:\n\n* James has a budgeriga as a pet (as concluded above).\n* Heather cannot have a snake as a pet (since James has a budgeriga), so she must have a snake as a pet.",
