Since Person B already has turkey puree, they cannot have Black Hawk Down (because then they would have two items in the \"Favourite Movie\" category). Therefore, Person B must prefer hurricane season.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that the person whose favourite season is the cherry blossom season is either Person A or has turkey puree as their baby food. Since Person B already has turkey puree and prefers hurricane season, Person A must prefer cherry blossom season.\n\nNow we can fill in the remaining blanks:\n\n* Person A has orzo pasta as baby food and prefers cherry blossom season, so they must have Legally Blonde as their favourite movie (because the person who likes Legally Blonde has orzo pasta or turkey puree, and Person A already has orzo pasta).\n* Person B has turkey puree as baby food and prefers hurricane season, so they must have Black Hawk Down as their favourite movie (because the person who prefers hurricane season either has Black Hawk Down or is Person B).",
