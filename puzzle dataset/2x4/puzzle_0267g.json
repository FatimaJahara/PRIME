This means Craig must have dusting as his household chore.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that one of Craig and Christy has a line as their shape and the other has a snake as their pet. Since Craig has dusting as his household chore, it's more likely that Craig has a line as his shape (dusting is a chore that involves straight lines). This means Christy must have a snake as her pet.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who has a koi fish as a pet is either named Craig or does roof maintenance as their household chore. Since Craig has dusting as his household chore, he cannot have a koi fish as his pet. This means Christy must have a koi fish as her pet, but we already know Christy has a snake as her pet. This is a contradiction, so the third clue must be referring to Craig's pet. This means Craig has a koi fish as his pet.\n\nNow we can fill in the grid:",
