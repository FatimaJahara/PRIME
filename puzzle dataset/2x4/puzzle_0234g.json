Since the person who wears pantyhose is not specified, it could be either Brett or Katrina.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that Katrina and the person who has green onion have different landform types, one has an ice field and the other has a scarp. This means that Katrina cannot have green onion, because if she did, she would have to have either an ice field or a scarp, but the clue states that the person who has green onion has the other landform type.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who has garam masala lives near a scarp landform type. Combining this with the first clue, we can conclude that Brett has garam masala and lives near a scarp, because if Katrina had garam masala, she would have to live near an ice field, but the second clue states that the person who has green onion has the other landform type.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n* Brett has garam masala and lives near a scarp.\n* Katrina has green onion and lives near an ice field.\n\nThe only remaining item is pantyhose, which must be worn by Katrina, because Brett already has a clothing item (bow tie).",
