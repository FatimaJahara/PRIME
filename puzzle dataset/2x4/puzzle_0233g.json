Since Person A can't have both a chess clock and a tower clock, and the person with the Chevrolet Corvette can't have both, one of them must have a chess clock and the other a tower clock.\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that Person A and Person B have different cars. Since Person A can't have both a Hyundai Kona and a Chevrolet Corvette, and Person B can't have both, one of them must have a Hyundai Kona and the other a Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who eats Greek pizza is either Person A or has a tower clock. This means that Person A can't eat ricotta and honey pizza, because if they did, the person who eats Greek pizza would have to be Person B, but then Person B would have to have a tower clock, which would mean that Person A has a chess clock, but we already know that Person A and the person with the Chevrolet Corvette have different types of clocks.\n\nSo, Person A must eat Greek pizza, and Person B must eat ricotta and honey pizza.\n\nNow, let's look at the cars. We know that Person A and Person B have different cars, and we know that Person A eats Greek pizza. From the second clue, we know that one of them has a Hyundai Kona and the other has a tower clock. Since Person A eats Greek pizza, they must have a Hyundai Kona, and Person B must have a Chevrolet Corvette.\n\nFinally, let's look at the clocks. We know that Person A and the person who has a Chevrolet Corvette have different types of clocks. Since Person A has a Hyundai Kona, they must have a chess clock, and Person B must have a tower clock.",
