The person whose plant parts are rhizomes does not have a stone arch bridge. (Clue 2)\n3. The person who has a stone arch bridge either has cobalt blue as their favourite color or is interested in flowers. (Clue 3)\n4. The person whose name is Person A has cobalt blue as their favourite color. (Clue 4)\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that Person A's favourite color is cobalt blue.\n\nFrom Clue 1, we know that Person A's favourite color is either cobalt blue or pearl white. Since Person A's favourite color is cobalt blue, Person B's favourite color must be pearl white.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person whose plant parts are rhizomes does not have a stone arch bridge. This means that Person A, who has cobalt blue as their favourite color, cannot have rhizomes as their plant parts. Therefore, Person A's plant parts must be flowers.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that the person who has a stone arch bridge either has cobalt blue as their favourite color or is interested in flowers. Since Person A has cobalt blue as their favourite color and flowers as their plant parts, Person A must have a stone arch bridge.\n\nNow, we can fill in the grid:",

Todd has cobalt blue as their favourite color.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know Todd's favourite color is cobalt blue. From clue 1, we can eliminate pearl white as Todd's favourite color.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible combinations:\n\n* If Todd has rhizomes, then from clue 2, Todd cannot have a stone arch bridge. But from clue 3, Todd has cobalt blue as their favourite color, which means Todd must have a stone arch bridge. This is a contradiction, so Todd cannot have rhizomes.\n* If Todd has flowers, then from clue 3, Todd can have a stone arch bridge. This is consistent with the other clues.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Todd has flowers and a stone arch bridge.\n\nNow, let's consider Crystal:\n\n* Crystal cannot have cobalt blue as their favourite color, since Todd already has it.\n* Crystal cannot have a stone arch bridge, since Todd already has it.\n* From clue 2, Crystal can have rhizomes, since Crystal does not have a stone arch bridge.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Crystal has pearl white as their favourite color, rhizomes, and a two-hinged arch bridge.",
