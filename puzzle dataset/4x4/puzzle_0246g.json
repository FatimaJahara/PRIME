Since Person A is already mentioned in Clue 7 as having Comet Ikeya-Seki, and Clue 8 says that the person with Comet Ikeya-Seki either feeds their baby pineapple mash or formula, we can conclude that Person A feeds their baby pineapple mash.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person who feeds their baby pineapple mash either does laundry or has Comet c/2022 e3. Since Person A feeds their baby pineapple mash, and we already know that Person A has Comet Ikeya-Seki, we can conclude that Person A does laundry.\n\nFrom Clue 1, we know that the person who saw the Great September Comet of 1882 and the one who does car washing have either pineapple mash or cauliflower puree as their baby food. Since Person A feeds their baby pineapple mash and does laundry, we can conclude that the person who does car washing has cauliflower puree.\n\nFrom Clue 6, we know that the person who feeds their baby cauliflower puree either does childcare or has Comet c/2022 e3. Since the person who does car washing has cauliflower puree, we can conclude that the person who does childcare has Comet c/2022 e3.\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that the three people are Person B, the one with formula, and the one with Comet c/2022 e3. Since we already know that Person A has Comet Ikeya-Seki, we can conclude that Person B has Comet c/2022 e3.\n\nFrom Clue 9, we know that of Person D and the person who grills, one has date puree and the other has cauliflower puree.
