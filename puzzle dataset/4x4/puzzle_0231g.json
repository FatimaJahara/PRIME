From Clue 11, we know the person who has a dump truck as their toy lives in an area with a ridge landform type. Therefore, Person C's landform type is a ridge.\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that of Person D and the person who has a crater as their landform type, one is associated with Faer\u00fbn, and the other is associated with Hyrule. Since Person C has a ridge landform type, Person C cannot be associated with a crater. Therefore, Person D must be associated with either Faer\u00fbn or Hyrule.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know the person who has fashion dolls does not live near a crater. From Clue 4, we know the person who has a crater as their landform type either has Pandora as their fictional world or has a makeup kit as their toy. Since Person D is associated with either Faer\u00fbn or Hyrule, Person D cannot have a crater as their landform type. Therefore, Person D's landform type is not a crater.\n\nFrom Clue 6, we know the person whose landform type is a moraine is not Person B. From Clue 12, we know the three people are the one with the moraine landform, the one from the fictional world of Faer\u00fbn, and Person D. Since Person D's landform type is not a crater, Person D's landform type must be a moraine.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know the person whose fictional world is Pandora either plays with fashion dolls or has a train set. From Clue 7, we know the person whose fictional world is Pandora is either Person A or has a makeup kit. Since Person D is associated with either Faer\u00fbn or Hyrule, Person D's fictional world is not Pandora. Therefore, Person A's fictional world is Pandora.\n\nFrom Clue 1, we know the person who has a makeup kit either is Person B or has Hyrule as their fictional world. Since Person A's fictional world is Pandora, Person A does not have a makeup kit. Therefore, Person B has a makeup kit.\n\nFrom Clue 9, we know the three people are the one from the fictional world of Pandora, the one with a ridge landform, and the one with a train set. Since Person A's fictional world is Pandora and Person C's landform type is a ridge, Person B must have a train set.\n\nFrom Clue 10, we know neither Person B nor Person C has fashion dolls as their toys. Since Person B has a train set and Person C has a dump truck, Person A must have fashion dolls.\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that of Person D and the person who has a crater as their landform type, one is associated with Faer\u00fbn, and the other is associated with Hyrule. Since Person D's landform type is a moraine, Person D must be associated with Faer\u00fbn. Therefore, Person C's fictional world is Hyrule.",

Since the person who has a crater as their landform type has a dump truck as their toy (Clue 4), and the person who has a dump truck as their toy is either named Curtis or has Hyrule as their fictional world (Clue 1), the person who has a crater as their landform type is associated with Hyrule.\n\nFrom Clue 10, neither Curtis nor Christy has a train set as their toy.

Since Candice has a makeup kit, the person with the moraine landform is associated with Faer\u00fbn.\n\nThe only person left is Curtis.

From clue 11, we know the person who has a train set as their toy lives in an area with a ridge landform type. Therefore, Christy's landform type is a ridge.\n\nFrom clue 9, we know neither Curtis nor Christy has fashion dolls as their toys. From clue 10, we know the three people are the one from the fictional world of Pandora, the one with a ridge landform, and the one with a dump truck. Since Christy already has a ridge landform, the other two people must be the ones from Pandora and the one with a dump truck. \n\nFrom clue 7, we know the person whose fictional world is Pandora is either named Corey or has a makeup kit as their toy. From clue 2, we know the person whose favorite fictional world is Pandora either plays with fashion dolls or has a dump truck. Since fashion dolls are not an option for Curtis or Christy, the person from Pandora must have fashion dolls. \n\nFrom clue 5, we know of Candice and the person who has a crater as their landform type, one is associated with Faer\u00fbn, and the other is associated with Hyrule. Since the person from Pandora has fashion dolls, the person with a crater must be either Candice or Corey. \n\nFrom clue 4, we know the person who has a crater as their landform type either has Pandora as their fictional world or plays with a makeup kit. Since the person from Pandora already has fashion dolls, the person with a crater must play with a makeup kit. \n\nFrom clue 1, we know the person who has a makeup kit as their toy is either named Curtis or has Hyrule as their fictional world. Since the person with a crater plays with a makeup kit, Curtis must have Hyrule as their fictional world. \n\nFrom clue 6, we know the person whose landform type is a moraine is not named Curtis. From clue 12, we know the three people are the one with the moraine landform, the one from the fictional world of Faer\u00fbn, and Candice. Since Curtis already has Hyrule, the person from Faer\u00fbn must be Candice. \n\nThe only remaining landform type is a seamount, which must belong to Corey.
