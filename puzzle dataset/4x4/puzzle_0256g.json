Clue 1: Person A and the person who has cheese pizza are on different ships, one on the R/V Sally Ride and the other on the AIDAnova.\n2. Clue 2: The person who eats alfredo pizza is either Person A or has an adventure map decoration.\n3. Clue 3: The person who has embellished mirrors either likes cheese pizza or white pizza.\n4. Clue 4: The three people are the one with the team flag, the one with cheese pizza, and the one with the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n5. Clue 5: The person whose ship is the R/V Sally Ride is either Person A or has an adventure map decoration.\n6. Clue 6: Person A does not have the AIDAnova as their ship.\n7. Clue 7: The person who eats alfredo pizza either has a team flag decoration or is Person C.\n8. Clue 8: The person whose ship is the HMS Prince of Wales is either Person B or Person D.\n9. Clue 9: The three people are the one with the adventure map, the one named Person C, and the one with the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n10. Clue 10: The person who likes white pizza either has embellished mirrors or a lace tablecloth.\n11. Clue 11: The three people are the one with the HMS Prince of Wales, the one with embellished mirrors, and Person D.\n\nFrom Clue 1, we know that Person A is not on the AIDAnova, and from Clue 6, we know that Person A is not on the AIDAnova. Therefore, Person A must be on the R/V Sally Ride.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person who eats alfredo pizza is either Person A or has an adventure map decoration. Since Person A is on the R/V Sally Ride, the person who eats alfredo pizza must have an adventure map decoration.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that the person who has embellished mirrors either likes cheese pizza or white pizza. Since the person who eats alfredo pizza has an adventure map decoration, the person who has embellished mirrors must like cheese pizza.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that the three people are the one with the team flag, the one with cheese pizza, and the one with the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Since the person who has embellished mirrors likes cheese pizza, the person with the team flag must be Person C.\n\nFrom Clue 5, we know that the person whose ship is the R/V Sally Ride is either Person A or has an adventure map decoration. Since Person A is on the R/V Sally Ride, the person with the adventure map decoration must be Person B.\n\nFrom Clue 7, we know that the person who eats alfredo pizza either has a team flag decoration or is Person C. Since Person C has the team flag decoration, the person who eats alfredo pizza must be Person B.\n\nFrom Clue 8, we know that the person whose ship is the HMS Prince of Wales is either Person B or Person D. Since Person B is on the R/V Sally Ride, the person whose ship is the HMS Prince of Wales must be Person D.\n\nFrom Clue 9, we know that the three people are the one with the adventure map, the one named Person C, and the one with the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Since Person B has the adventure map decoration, the person with the USS Theodore Roosevelt must be Person A.\n\nFrom Clue 10, we know that the person who likes white pizza either has embellished mirrors or a lace tablecloth. Since the person who has embellished mirrors likes cheese pizza, the person who likes white pizza must have a lace tablecloth.\n\nFrom Clue 11, we know that the three people are the one with the HMS Prince of Wales, the one with embellished mirrors, and Person D. Since Person D is on the HMS Prince of Wales, the person with embellished mirrors must be Person C.",

                    "reasoning": "From the given clues, we can start by analyzing the information provided:\n\n1. Chad and the person who has cheese pizza are on different ships, one on the R/V Sally Ride and the other on the AIDAnova.\n2. The person who eats alfredo pizza is either named Chad or has embellished mirrors as their decoration.\n3. The person with a team flag decoration either eats cheese pizza or white pizza.\n4. The three people are the one with the lace tablecloth, the one with cheese pizza, and the one with the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n5. The person whose ship is the R/V Sally Ride is either named Chad or has embellished mirrors as their decoration.\n6. Chad does not have the Aidanova as his ship.\n7. The person who likes alfredo pizza either uses a lace tablecloth or is named Carrie.\n8. The person whose ship is the HMS Prince of Wales is either Edward or Tina.\n9. The three people are the one with embellished mirrors, the one named Carrie, and the one with the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n10. The person who eats white pizza either has a team flag or an adventure map.\n11. The three people are the one with the HMS Prince of Wales, the one with the team flag, and Tina.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that the person with the lace tablecloth is not Chad, since Chad is not on the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Also, from clue 6, Chad is not on the Aidanova. Therefore, Chad must be on the R/V Sally Ride.\n\nFrom clue 2, the person who eats alfredo pizza is either Chad or has embellished mirrors. Since Chad is on the R/V Sally Ride, the person who eats alfredo pizza must have embellished mirrors.\n\nFrom clue 7, the person who likes alfredo pizza either uses a lace tablecloth or is named Carrie. Since the person who eats alfredo pizza has embellished mirrors, Carrie must be the one who likes alfredo pizza.\n\nFrom clue 3, the person with a team flag decoration either eats cheese pizza or white pizza. Since Carrie likes alfredo pizza, Carrie cannot have a team flag decoration. Therefore, the person with a team flag decoration must eat either cheese pizza or white pizza.\n\nFrom clue 10, the person who eats white pizza either has a team flag or an adventure map. Since the person with a team flag decoration eats either cheese pizza or white pizza, the person who eats white pizza must have an adventure map.\n\nFrom clue 8, the person whose ship is the HMS Prince of Wales is either Edward or Tina. Since Tina is one of the three people with the HMS Prince of Wales, the team flag, and Tina (clue 11), Tina must be the one with the HMS Prince of Wales.\n\nFrom clue 9, the three people are the one with embellished mirrors, the one named Carrie, and the one with the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Since Carrie likes alfredo pizza and has embellished mirrors, the person with the USS Theodore Roosevelt must be Edward.\n\nFrom clue 1, Chad and the person who has cheese pizza are on different ships, one on the R/V Sally Ride and the other on the AIDAnova. Since Chad is on the R/V Sally Ride, the person who has cheese pizza must be on the AIDAnova. Also, from clue 4, the person with the lace tablecloth is not Chad, and the person with cheese pizza is not on the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Therefore, the person with the lace tablecloth must be on the AIDAnova.",
