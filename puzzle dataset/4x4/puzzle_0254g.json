So, the person with the prostate must be Jared.\n\nFrom Clue 3, neither the person with a Nissan Versa nor the person with a Ford Fiesta is named Travis. Also, from Clue 4, neither of them has the prostate as their organ. Since Jared has the prostate, he can't have a Nissan Versa or a Ford Fiesta.\n\nFrom Clue 2, the three people are the one with the McLaren 720S, the one with seminal vesicles, and Tara. Since Travis has the brain and Jared has the prostate, the person with seminal vesicles must be Carrie.\n\nFrom Clue 7, of Travis and the person who has whole wheat, one has a McLaren 720S, and the other has a Nissan Versa. Since Travis has the brain, he can't have whole wheat. So, the person with whole wheat must be either Jared or Carrie. But from Clue 1, the person with the prostate (Jared) is either named Jared or eats whole wheat. So, Jared must eat whole wheat.\n\nFrom Clue 8, of the person with a prostate (Jared) and the one with a McLaren 720S, one has amaranth, and the other has grain. Since Jared eats whole wheat, he can't have amaranth or grain. So, the person with a McLaren 720S must have either amaranth or grain.\n\nFrom Clue 6, Tara has either amaranth or whole wheat, and the person with the prostate (Jared) has the other.

                    "reasoning": "From the given clues, we can start by analyzing the information provided.\n\n1. The person whose associated organ is the prostate is either named Jared or eats whole wheat.\n   - This clue tells us that either Jared has the prostate as his organ, or the person who eats whole wheat has the prostate as their organ.\n\n2. The three people are the one with the Nissan Versa, the one with seminal vesicles, and Tara.\n   - This clue tells us that Tara is one of the three people, and the other two people have the Nissan Versa and seminal vesicles as their car and organ, respectively.\n\n3. Neither the person who owns a McLaren 720S nor the one who owns a Bentley Continental GTC is named Travis.\n   - This clue tells us that Travis does not own a McLaren 720S or a Bentley Continental GTC.\n\n4. Neither the person with a McLaren 720S nor the one with a Bentley Continental GTC has the prostate as their organ.\n   - This clue tells us that the person with the prostate as their organ does not own a McLaren 720S or a Bentley Continental GTC.\n\n5. The person whose name is Travis has the brain as their associated organ.\n   - This clue tells us that Travis has the brain as his associated organ.\n\n6. Of Tara and the person with a prostate, one has amaranth, and the other has whole wheat.\n   - This clue tells us that either Tara has amaranth and the person with the prostate has whole wheat, or Tara has whole wheat and the person with the prostate has amaranth.\n\n7. Of Travis and the person who has whole wheat, one has a Nissan Versa, and the other has a McLaren 720S.\n   - This clue tells us that either Travis has a Nissan Versa and the person who has whole wheat has a McLaren 720S, or Travis has a McLaren 720S and the person who has whole wheat has a Nissan Versa.\n\n8. Of the person with a prostate and the one with a Nissan Versa, one has amaranth, and the other has grain.\n   - This clue tells us that either the person with the prostate has amaranth and the person with the Nissan Versa has grain, or the person with the prostate has grain and the person with the Nissan Versa has amaranth.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information provided and fill in the grid accordingly.\n\n- From clue 5, we know that Travis has the brain as his associated organ.\n- From clue 3, we know that Travis does not own a McLaren 720S or a Bentley Continental GTC. Therefore, Travis must own the Ford Fiesta.\n- From clue 7, we know that either Travis has a Nissan Versa and the person who has whole wheat has a McLaren 720S, or Travis has a McLaren 720S and the person who has whole wheat has a Nissan Versa. Since Travis owns the Ford Fiesta, the person who has whole wheat must own the McLaren 720S.\n- From clue 1, we know that either Jared has the prostate as his organ, or the person who eats whole wheat has the prostate as their organ. Since the person who has whole wheat owns the McLaren 720S, Jared must have the prostate as his organ.\n- From clue 6, we know that either Tara has amaranth and the person with the prostate has whole wheat, or Tara has whole wheat and the person with the prostate has amaranth. Since Jared has the prostate as his organ, Tara must have amaranth.\n- From clue 8, we know that either the person with the prostate has amaranth and the person with the Nissan Versa has grain, or the person with the prostate has grain and the person with the Nissan Versa has amaranth. Since Jared has the prostate as his organ and Tara has amaranth, the person with the Nissan Versa must have grain.\n- From clue 2, we know that the three people are the one with the Nissan Versa, the one with seminal vesicles, and Tara. Since Tara has amaranth and the person with the Nissan Versa has grain, the person with seminal vesicles must be Carrie.\n- From clue 4, we know that neither the person with a McLaren 720S nor the one with a Bentley Continental GTC has the prostate as their organ. Since Jared has the prostate as his organ, the person who owns the Bentley Continental GTC must be Carrie.\n- The only remaining car is the Nissan Versa, which must be owned by Tara.",
