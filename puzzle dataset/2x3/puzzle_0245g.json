This means that the person whose hobby is embroidery cannot have an amphitheater as their building type (since it's either/or). Therefore, we can conclude that the person whose hobby is embroidery lives in a gymnasium.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that Person B has a building type of amphitheater. Since Person B cannot have a gymnasium as their building type (because Person B has an amphitheater), we can conclude that Person A must have a gymnasium as their building type.\n\nNow, let's look at the hobbies. We know that the person whose hobby is embroidery lives in a gymnasium, and we've already determined that Person A has a gymnasium as their building type.

(Clue 1)\n2. The person whose hobby is embroidery lives in a gymnasium. (Clue 2)\n3. The person whose name is Stephanie has a building type of amphitheater. (Clue 3)\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is embroidery lives in a gymnasium. Combining this with Clue 1, we can conclude that the person whose hobby is embroidery cannot have an amphitheater as their building type, since it's already established that they live in a gymnasium.\n\nNow, let's look at Clue 3, which states that Stephanie has a building type of amphitheater. Since we've already established that the person whose hobby is embroidery lives in a gymnasium, and Stephanie has an amphitheater, we can conclude that Stephanie's hobby is not embroidery.\n\nThe only remaining hobby is martial arts, which must be Stephanie's hobby. Therefore, Craig's hobby must be embroidery, and since the person whose hobby is embroidery lives in a gymnasium (Clue 2), Craig's building type is a gymnasium.",
