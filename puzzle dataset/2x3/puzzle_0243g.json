However, the second clue, \"The person who has thyroid disease likes cavatappi pasta,\" tells us that the person with thyroid disease actually likes cavatappi pasta. This means that the person with thyroid disease cannot be James, because if James had thyroid disease, he would like quadrucci pasta, not cavatappi pasta. Therefore, the person with thyroid disease must be April.\n\nNow that we know April has thyroid disease, we can look at the pasta preferences. Since April has thyroid disease and likes cavatappi pasta, James must like quadrucci pasta.\n\nAs for the health condition of James, since April has thyroid disease, James must have inguinal hernia.",
