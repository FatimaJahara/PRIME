Since we already know that Person A's pet is named Coco (from the first clue), we can conclude that Person A's favourite music is riot grrrl.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining options. We know that Person B's pet is not named Coco (since Person A's pet is named Coco), so Person B's pet must be named Astro.

However, we cannot conclude that Lauren's favourite music is riot grrrl because the clue states \"either/or,\" indicating that these are separate entities.\n\nThe second clue, \"The person whose favourite music is delta blues has a pet named coco,\" directly tells us that the person who likes delta blues has a pet named Coco. Since we know from the first clue that the person with the pet named Coco either likes riot grrrl or is Lauren, and now we know that this person likes delta blues, we can conclude that Lauren must like delta blues because the first clue's \"either/or\" condition is satisfied by Lauren being the one with the pet named Coco, thus not needing to like riot grrrl.\n\nGiven that Lauren likes delta blues and has Coco as her pet, we can fill in Lauren's information. Since Chad is the only one left, and we know that the person with the pet named Coco likes delta blues (which is Lauren), Chad must have the pet named Astro. Also, since Lauren likes delta blues, Chad must like riot grrrl.",
