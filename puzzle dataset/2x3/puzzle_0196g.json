Since Kristy already likes mud flats, Mad Max: Fury Road must be Kristy's favourite movie.\n\n```\n{\n    \"timothy\": {\n        \"Favourite Movie\": \"?\",\n        \"Water Bodies\": \"?\"\n    },\n    \"kristy\": {\n        \"Favourite Movie\": \"mad max: fury road\",\n        \"Water Bodies\": \"mud flat\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who has a glacier cave as their water body is either Timothy or Kristy.
