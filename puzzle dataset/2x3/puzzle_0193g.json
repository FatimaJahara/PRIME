This clue does not tell us who has fairy lights, but it does tell us that whoever has fairy lights does not worship Astrilde.\n\nThe third clue, \"Of Person A and the person who has Astrilde as their Norse god, one has fairy lights, and the other has an action movie poster as their decoration,\" tells us that Person A and the person who worships Astrilde have different decorations. Since Person A and the person who worships Astrilde cannot have the same decoration, and Person B is either someone who has fairy lights or someone who has an action movie poster, we can deduce that Person B must worship Astrilde. If Person B did not worship Astrilde, then Person A and the person who worships Astrilde would have to have the same decoration, which is not possible.\n\nNow that we know Person B worships Astrilde, we can use the second clue to determine that Person B does not have fairy lights. Therefore, Person B must have an action movie poster.\n\nSince Person B has an action movie poster, Person A must have fairy lights.

This means that if Tara has fairy lights, she must worship Skadi, and if Nicholas has fairy lights, he must worship Skadi as well.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that of Nicholas and the person who has Astrilde as their Norse God, one has fairy lights, and the other has an action movie poster as their decoration. This means that Nicholas cannot have Astrilde as his Norse God, because if he did, he would have to have fairy lights, but then the person who has Astrilde would have to have an action movie poster, which would mean that Tara has fairy lights, but we already know that Tara either has fairy lights or an action movie poster, not both.\n\nTherefore, Nicholas must have Skadi as his Norse God, and Tara must have Astrilde as her Norse God.
