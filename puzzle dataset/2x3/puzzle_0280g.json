This means that one of the people (Bradley or Tracy) was born in September, and the other was born in November.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person born in September either has Mad Max: Fury Road or Beauty and the Beast as their favourite movie.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that of Bradley and the person born in September, one has Mad Max: Fury Road as their favourite movie, and the other has Beauty and the Beast. This means that Bradley cannot have the same favourite movie as the person born in September.\n\nFrom the fifth clue, we know that the person whose birth month is November does not have Beauty and the Beast as their favourite movie. This means that the person born in November must have Mad Max: Fury Road as their favourite movie.\n\nNow, let's combine the information:\n\n* The person born in September is either Bradley or Tracy.\n* The person born in November is the other one (either Bradley or Tracy).\n* The person born in September has either Mad Max: Fury Road or Beauty and the Beast as their favourite movie.\n* Bradley and the person born in September have different favourite movies.\n* The person born in November has Mad Max: Fury Road as their favourite movie.\n\nFrom this, we can conclude that:\n\n* Tracy was born in September and has Beauty and the Beast as her favourite movie.\n* Bradley was born in November and has Mad Max: Fury Road as his favourite movie.",
