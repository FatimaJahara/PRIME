Since Brandy is already associated with lawrencium, the person whose chemical compound is tennessine must have Victoria Magazine as their favourite.\n\nNow, let's look at the remaining options. We have Wesley, who is not associated with lawrencium (since Brandy is), and History of War magazine, which is not associated with Brandy (since Victoria Magazine is associated with the person whose chemical compound is tennessine).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Wesley is associated with the chemical compound tennessine and History of War magazine.",
