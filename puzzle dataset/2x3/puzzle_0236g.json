This means that Shaun can't have fuchsia (since Wendy might have it), and Wendy can't have salmon (since Shaun might have it).\n\nNow, let's combine the information:\n\n* If Wendy has fuchsia, then the person with the elver has midnight blue (from the first clue). But then Shaun would have salmon (from the second clue), which means Wendy can't have salmon (since Shaun has it). This creates a contradiction, so Wendy can't have fuchsia.\n* Therefore, Wendy has midnight blue, and the person with the elver has fuchsia (from the first clue).\n* Since Shaun can't have fuchsia (from the second clue), Shaun must have salmon.",
