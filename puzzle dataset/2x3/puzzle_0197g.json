But then, the person who likes battle rap cannot have a ball python as their snake (from the second clue), which means Brent must listen to battle rap and have an inland taipan as his snake.\n* If Amy does not have a ball python as her snake, then she must listen to battle rap (since she cannot listen to K-pop, as per the first clue). But then, the person who likes battle rap has a ball python as their snake (from the second clue), which means Brent must listen to K-pop and have an inland taipan as his snake.\n\nIn both cases, we can conclude that Amy listens to battle rap and Brent listens to K-pop.
