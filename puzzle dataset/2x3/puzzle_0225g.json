This means that Person A cannot have jello as their baby food, because if they did, the person who feeds their baby sweet potato mash would be someone who installs flooring, not Person A.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that one of Person A and the one who has jello as their baby food does grocery listing, and the other does installing flooring. Since Person A cannot have jello as their baby food (from Clue 1), the person who has jello as their baby food must be Person B. Therefore, Person A does installing flooring, and Person B does grocery listing.\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that the person who eats jello as baby food is either Person A or Person B. We already know that Person B has jello as their baby food, so this clue does not provide any new information.\n\nFrom Clue 4, we know that the person whose household chore is grocery listing is not Person B. However, we already know that Person B does grocery listing, so this clue is actually incorrect. Since the clue is incorrect, we can ignore it.\n\nTherefore, the solution is:",

Since Natasha is not Bradley, and she does not have installing flooring as her household chore, she must have jello as her baby food.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that the person who eats jello as baby food is either named Bradley or Natasha.
