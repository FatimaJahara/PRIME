Since Tracy is associated with NGC 253, the person who drinks green tea cannot be Tracy (because Tracy is already associated with NGC 253). Therefore, the person who drinks green tea must be Phillip.\n\nNow we have:\n\n- Phillip drinks green tea\n- Tracy is associated with NGC 253\n\nThe only remaining item in the \"Beverage\" category is \"gin and tonic\", which must be assigned to Tracy.\n\nThe only remaining item in the \"Galaxy\" category is \"small magellanic cloud\", which must be assigned to Phillip.",
