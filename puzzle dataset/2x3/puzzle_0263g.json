However, from the second clue, we already know that Brett is associated with tungsten. Therefore, this clue implies that Brett dresses up as Mrs Incredible, as Tina is the only other option and would contradict the second clue.\n\nNow, we can conclude that:\n\n- Brett is associated with tungsten and dresses up as Mrs Incredible.\n- Tina is associated with antimony (the only remaining option) and dresses up as a Yeti (the only remaining costume).",
