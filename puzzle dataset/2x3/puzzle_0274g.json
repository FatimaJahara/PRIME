Since there are only two beverages, beer and champagne, this means that one of them drinks beer and the other drinks champagne.\n\nFrom the second clue, \"The person whose name is Tiffany likes beer,\" we can directly assign beer to Tiffany.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities:\n\n* If Sean drinks beer, then the person born in January would drink champagne (from the first clue). But this would mean that Tiffany, who likes beer, is not the person born in January. This would leave Sean as the person born in January, which would mean that Sean drinks beer and champagne at the same time, which is not possible.\n* Therefore, Sean must drink champagne, and the person born in January must drink beer. Since Tiffany likes beer, she must be the person born in January.",
