However, from the second clue, \"The person whose name is Donald does not have painting as their household chore,\" we know that Donald does not have painting as his household chore. Therefore, the person who flies a Cirrus SR22 must be the person who has painting as their household chore, and it cannot be Donald.\n\nSince Donald does not fly a Cirrus SR22 and does not have painting as his household chore, he must fly an Airbus Beluga and have childcare as his household chore.\n\nThe only remaining option for Erica is to fly a Cirrus SR22 and have painting as her household chore.",
