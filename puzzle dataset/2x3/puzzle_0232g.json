But then, the person born in 2001 must drink smoothies (from the third clue), which contradicts the second clue. Therefore, Justin cannot drink smoothies.\n* If Justin drinks bourbon, then Katrina must drink smoothies (from the second clue). This is consistent with the third clue, which says that the person who drinks smoothies is either Justin or the person born in 2010. Since Justin drinks bourbon, the person born in 2010 must drink smoothies.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that:\n\n* Justin drinks bourbon and was born in 2001.\n* Katrina drinks smoothies and was born in 2010.",
