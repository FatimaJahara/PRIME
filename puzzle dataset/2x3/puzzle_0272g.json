Therefore, Lauren must live in one of the housing types, and the roller derby participant must live in the other.\n\nFrom the second clue, \"Of Jeremiah and Lauren, one participates in roller derby and the other lives in a cottage,\" we can conclude that Jeremiah participates in roller derby. If Jeremiah lived in a cottage, then Lauren would have to participate in roller derby, which contradicts the first clue. Therefore, Jeremiah participates in roller derby, and Lauren lives in a cottage.\n\nNow, we know that Lauren lives in a cottage, and Jeremiah participates in roller derby. From the first clue, we also know that the roller derby participant lives in an adobe house. Therefore, Jeremiah lives in an adobe house.\n\nThe only remaining category is rugby, which must be assigned to Lauren.",
