This means that Dana does not have edible plants, and the person who has edible plants does not have salad.\n\nNow, let's combine the information from the two clues. If Dana has succulents, then the person who eats hot dogs is William, and the person who has edible plants is the one who has salad. But this would mean that Dana has succulents and edible plants, which is not possible. Therefore, Dana does not have succulents.\n\nSo, William has succulents, and Dana eats hot dogs. The person who has salad must have edible plants, and that person is William. Therefore, Dana has edible plants.",
