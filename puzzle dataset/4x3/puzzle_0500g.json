Since the person with beech trees cannot be the event planner (Clue 2), and Person D has either a larch tree or a beech tree (Clue 3), Person D must have a beech tree, and the mathematician must have a larch tree.\n\nNow, let's look at Clue 1. We know that Person B and the librarian have different types of trees. Since Person B is not the event planner (Clue 4), and the person with beech trees cannot be the event planner (Clue 2), Person B must have a tea tree, and the librarian must have a larch tree.\n\nWe also know that the person with beech trees is not the event planner (Clue 2), and Person D has a beech tree. Therefore, Person D is not the event planner.\n\nThe only person left who can be the event planner is Person A.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we have so far:\n\n- Person A is the event planner.\n- Person B has a tea tree.\n- Person D has a beech tree.\n- The mathematician has a larch tree.\n- The librarian has a larch tree.\n\nThe only occupation left for Person C is the soldier.\n\nThe only tree left for Person C is the lemon tree.",

Since Stacey cannot be the event planner (clue 2), Stacey must be the librarian. Therefore, Stacey has a beech tree.\n\n- From clue 1, we know that Seth and the soldier have different trees, and one of them has a larch tree while the other has a tea tree. Since Seth is not an event planner (clue 4), Seth must be the soldier. Therefore, Seth has a larch tree.\n\n- From clue 2, we know that the person with beech trees (Stacey) and the person with larch trees (Seth) are not event planners. Therefore, the event planner must have either a tea tree or a lemon tree.\n\n- From clue 5, we know that Megan is neither an event planner nor a librarian. Therefore, Megan must be the soldier, and she has a tea tree.\n\n- The only remaining occupation is mathematician, which must be Brian. The only remaining tree is lemon tree, which must also be Brian's.",
