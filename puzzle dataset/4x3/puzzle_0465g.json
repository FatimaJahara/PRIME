(Clue 1)\n   - This means Person D weighs either 60 kg or 91 kg.\n\n2. Person D either wears a suit or a midi dress. (Clue 2)\n   - This gives us two possible clothing options for Person D.\n\n3. Neither the person who weighs 56 kg nor the one who weighs 60 kg is Person D. (Clue 3)\n   - This means Person D weighs 91 kg.\n\n4. Neither the person who weighs 91 kg nor the one who weighs 96 kg wears cargo pants. (Clue 4)\n   - This means the person who weighs 91 kg (Person D) does not wear cargo pants.\n\n5. The three people are the one who weighs 96 kg, the one named Person C, and the one wearing a midi dress. (Clue 5)\n   - This means Person C weighs 96 kg and wears a midi dress.\n\n6. Neither the person who wears cargo pants nor the one who wears a suit weighs 96 kg. (Clue 6)\n   - This means the person who wears a suit does not weigh 96 kg.\n\n7. Neither the person who weighs 91 kg nor the one who weighs 96 kg is Person C. (Clue 7)\n   - This is already deduced in Clue 5.\n\n8. The three people are the one named Person B, the one wearing cargo pants, and the one who weighs 91 kg. (Clue 8)\n   - This means Person B wears cargo pants and weighs 91 kg.\n\n9. Person C either wears scarves or cargo pants. (Clue 9)\n   - Since Person C wears a midi dress (Clue 5), this clue is not useful.\n\n10. The three people are the one wearing a suit, the one who weighs 56 kg, and Person D. (Clue 10)\n    - This means Person D wears a suit and weighs 56 kg is not possible since Person D weighs 91 kg (Clue 3).\n\n11. Neither Person B nor Person C weighs 96 kg. (Clue 11)\n    - This is already deduced in Clue 5.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid:\n\n- Person D weighs 91 kg and wears a suit (Clue 3 and Clue 10).\n- Person B weighs 91 kg and wears cargo pants (Clue 8).\n- Person C weighs 96 kg and wears a midi dress (Clue 5).\n- Person A is the only one left, so Person A weighs 56 kg and wears scarves (the only remaining clothing option).",

Sarah either wears a suit or a midi dress.\n3. Neither the person who weighs 56 kg nor the one who weighs 60 kg is named Sarah.\n4. Neither the person who weighs 91 kg nor the one who weighs 96 kg wears scarves.\n5. The three people are the one who weighs 96 kg, the one named Wendy, and the one with the midi dress.\n6. Neither the person who wears scarves nor the one who wears a suit weighs 96 kg.\n7. Neither the person who weighs 91 kg nor the one who weighs 96 kg is named Wendy.\n8. The three people are the one named George, the one who wears scarves, and the one who weighs 91 kg.\n9. Wendy either wears cargo pants or scarves.\n10. The three people are the one wearing a suit, the one who weighs 56 kg, and Sarah.\n11. Neither George nor Wendy weighs 96 kg.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that Wendy and the person with the midi dress are not the same person, and the person who weighs 96 kg is not Wendy. From clue 7, we know that the person who weighs 91 kg is not Wendy. Therefore, Wendy must weigh 60 kg.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Sarah either wears a suit or a midi dress. From clue 10, we know that Sarah is one of the three people, along with the person who weighs 56 kg and the one wearing a suit. Since Sarah cannot weigh 56 kg (clue 1), she must wear a suit.\n\nFrom clue 8, we know that George wears scarves and weighs 91 kg.\n\nFrom clue 9, we know that Wendy either wears cargo pants or scarves. Since George already wears scarves, Wendy must wear cargo pants.\n\nThe only remaining person is Cory, who must weigh 96 kg and wear the midi dress.",

(Clue 1)\n   - This means Sarah's weight is either 60 kg or 91 kg.\n\n2. Sarah either wears a midi dress or a suit. (Clue 2)\n   - This gives us two possible clothing options for Sarah.\n\n3. Neither the person who weighs 56 kg nor the one who weighs 60 kg is named Sarah. (Clue 3)\n   - This means Sarah's weight is 91 kg, as 60 kg is also ruled out.\n\n4. Neither the person who weighs 91 kg nor the one who weighs 96 kg wears cargo pants. (Clue 4)\n   - This means the person who weighs 91 kg (Sarah) does not wear cargo pants.\n\n5. The three people are the one who weighs 96 kg, the one named Wendy, and the one wearing a suit. (Clue 5)\n   - This means Wendy does not weigh 96 kg, and the person wearing a suit is either Wendy or the person who weighs 96 kg.\n\n6. Neither the person who wears cargo pants nor the one who wears midi dresses weighs 96 kg. (Clue 6)\n   - This means the person who weighs 96 kg does not wear cargo pants or midi dresses.\n\n7. Neither the person who weighs 91 kg nor the one who weighs 96 kg is named Wendy. (Clue 7)\n   - This means Wendy's weight is either 56 kg or 60 kg.\n\n8. The three people are the one named George, the one wearing cargo pants, and the one who weighs 91 kg. (Clue 8)\n   - This means George is either the one wearing cargo pants or the one who weighs 91 kg (Sarah).\n\n9. Wendy either wears scarves or cargo pants. (Clue 9)\n   - This gives us two possible clothing options for Wendy.\n\n10. The three people are the one wearing a midi dress, the one who weighs 56 kg, and Sarah. (Clue 10)\n    - This means Sarah wears a midi dress, and the person who weighs 56 kg is either George or Cory.\n\n11. Neither George nor Wendy weighs 96 kg. (Clue 11)\n    - This confirms that George and Wendy do not weigh 96 kg.\n\nFrom the above deductions, we can conclude the following:\n\n- Sarah weighs 91 kg and wears a midi dress.\n- Wendy weighs 60 kg and wears scarves (since cargo pants are ruled out by Clue 8).\n- George weighs 96 kg and wears a suit (since cargo pants are ruled out by Clue 4).\n- Cory weighs 56 kg and wears cargo pants.",
