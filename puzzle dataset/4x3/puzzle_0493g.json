Since Person D has favourite number 33.0, the person who has spinach must have favourite number 5.0.\n- From clue 1, we know that Person A and the person who likes bacon have different favourite numbers, 5.0 and 53.0. Since the person who has spinach has favourite number 5.0, Person A must have favourite number 53.0.\n- From clue 4, we know that the person with favourite number 97.0 is either Person A or Person B. Since Person A has favourite number 53.0, the person with favourite number 97.0 must be Person B.\n- From clue 6, we know that Person A and the person with favourite number 97 have different foods, spinach and granola. Since Person A has favourite number 53.0 and the person with favourite number 97.0 is Person B, Person A must have granola and Person B must have spinach.\n- From clue 3, we know that Person A and Person C do not have bbq as their food. Since Person A has granola, Person C must have bacon.\n- From clue 5, we know that the person with favourite number 33.0 and the person with favourite number 5.0 do not have bacon as their food. Since Person D has favourite number 33.0 and the person who has spinach has favourite number 5.0, the person who has bacon must be Person C.",

Corey and the person who likes spinach have favourite numbers 5.0 and 53.0, but we don't know who has which number yet.\n2. The person whose favourite number is 33.0 is either Megan or Kristy.\n3. Corey and Megan do not have granola as their food.\n4. The person whose favourite number is 97.0 is either Corey or Luke.\n5. The person whose favourite number is 33.0 and the person whose favourite number is 5.0 do not have spinach as their food.\n6. Corey and the person whose favourite number is 97.0 like bacon and barbecue, but we don't know who likes which yet.\n7. Megan's favourite number is not 33.0.\n8. Kristy and the person who has bacon have favourite numbers 5.0 and 33.0, but we don't know who has which number yet.\n\nNow, let's analyze the clues step by step:\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that the person whose favourite number is 33.0 is either Megan or Kristy. But from clue 7, we know that Megan's favourite number is not 33.0. Therefore, Kristy's favourite number is 33.0.\n\nFrom clue 8, we know that Kristy and the person who has bacon have favourite numbers 5.0 and 33.0. Since Kristy's favourite number is 33.0, the person who has bacon must have favourite number 5.0.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that Corey and the person who likes spinach have favourite numbers 5.0 and 53.0. But we already know that the person who has bacon has favourite number 5.0. Therefore, Corey must have favourite number 53.0, and the person who likes spinach must have favourite number 5.0.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that the person whose favourite number is 97.0 is either Corey or Luke. But we already know that Corey's favourite number is 53.0. Therefore, Luke's favourite number is 97.0.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that Corey and the person whose favourite number is 97.0 like bacon and barbecue. But we already know that Corey's favourite number is 53.0, and Luke's favourite number is 97.0. Therefore, Corey likes barbecue, and Luke likes bacon.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that Corey and Megan do not have granola as their food. We already know that Corey likes barbecue, and Luke likes bacon. Therefore, Megan must have granola as her food.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that the person whose favourite number is 33.0 and the person whose favourite number is 5.0 do not have spinach as their food. We already know that Kristy's favourite number is 33.0, and the person who likes spinach has favourite number 5.0. Therefore, the person who likes spinach must be Luke.\n\nNow, we can fill in the grid:",

Since Corey's favourite number is not 33.0 (clue 2), Corey's favourite number must be 5.0.\n* The person who likes bacon has 53.0 as their favourite number (clue 1).

Since Megan's favourite number is not 33.0 (clue 7), Kristy's favourite number must be 33.0.\n* The person whose favourite number is 97.0 is either Corey or Luke (clue 4). Since Corey's favourite number is 5.0, Luke's favourite number must be 97.0.\n* Of Corey and the person whose favourite number is 97, one has spinach, and the other has granola as their food (clue 6). Since Luke's favourite number is 97.0, Luke must have granola as their food, and Corey must have spinach as their food.\n* Of Kristy and the person who has spinach, one has 5.0 as their favourite number, and the other has 33.0 as their favourite number (clue 8). Since Corey has spinach as their food and 5.0 as their favourite number, Kristy must have 33.0 as their favourite number and BBQ as their food.",
