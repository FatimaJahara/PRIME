Neither the person living in a chateau nor the one living in a mobile home is Person C.\n3. The person who drinks scotch is either Person A or Person B.\n4. Of Person B and the person who lives in a split-level house, one drinks scotch, and the other drinks an appletini.\n5. Person D either drinks an appletini or protein shakes.\n6. The person whose name is Person D lives in a mobile home.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that Person C does not live in a chateau or a mobile home. From clue 1, we know that Person C is one of the three people, along with the one living in a townhouse and the one who drinks scotch. Since Person C does not live in a chateau or a mobile home, they must live in a townhouse.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that the person who drinks scotch is either Person A or Person B. From clue 4, we know that one of Person B and the person who lives in a split-level house drinks scotch, and the other drinks an appletini. Since Person B is one of the options for drinking scotch, the person who lives in a split-level house must drink an appletini.\n\nFrom clue 5, we know that Person D either drinks an appletini or protein shakes. Since the person who lives in a split-level house drinks an appletini, Person D must drink protein shakes.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that Person D lives in a mobile home.\n\nNow, let's fill in the grid:\n\n```\n{\n    \"Person A\": {\n        \"Beverage\": \"ros\u00e9\",\n        \"Housing Type\": \"chateau\"\n    },\n    \"Person B\": {\n        \"Beverage\": \"scotch\",\n        \"Housing Type\": \"split-level house\"\n    },\n    \"Person C\": {\n        \"Beverage\": \"appletini\",\n        \"Housing Type\": \"townhouse\"\n    },\n    \"Person D\": {\n        \"Beverage\": \"protein shakes\",\n        \"Housing Type\": \"mobile home\"\n    }\n}\n```",

The three people are the one living in a townhouse, the one who drinks protein shakes, and Christina.\n   - This clue tells us that Christina lives in a townhouse.\n\n2. Neither the person who lives in a chateau nor the one who lives in a mobile home is named Christina.\n   - This clue tells us that Christina does not live in a chateau or a mobile home.\n\n3. The person who drinks protein shakes is either Douglas or James.\n   - This clue tells us that either Douglas or James drinks protein shakes.\n\n4. Of James and the person who lives in a split-level house, one drinks protein shakes, and the other drinks ros\u00e9.\n   - This clue tells us that James drinks either protein shakes or ros\u00e9, and the person who lives in a split-level house drinks the other.\n\n5. Tanya drinks either ros\u00e9 or an appletini.\n   - This clue tells us that Tanya drinks either ros\u00e9 or an appletini.\n\n6. The person whose name is Tanya lives in a mobile home.\n   - This clue tells us that Tanya lives in a mobile home.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information we have so far:\n\n- Christina lives in a townhouse.\n- Tanya lives in a mobile home.\n- Either Douglas or James drinks protein shakes.\n- James drinks either protein shakes or ros\u00e9.\n- Tanya drinks either ros\u00e9 or an appletini.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that James drinks either protein shakes or ros\u00e9, and the person who lives in a split-level house drinks the other. Since Tanya drinks either ros\u00e9 or an appletini, and she lives in a mobile home, the person who lives in a split-level house must drink ros\u00e9. Therefore, James drinks protein shakes.\n\nNow we know that James drinks protein shakes, and either Douglas or James drinks protein shakes. Therefore, Douglas does not drink protein shakes.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the three people are the one living in a townhouse, the one who drinks protein shakes, and Christina. We already know that Christina lives in a townhouse, and James drinks protein shakes. Therefore, the third person must be Douglas, who lives in a chateau (since Christina does not live in a chateau or a mobile home).\n\nNow we have:\n\n- Christina lives in a townhouse and drinks scotch (since the other drinks are already assigned).\n- James drinks protein shakes and lives in a split-level house.\n- Douglas lives in a chateau and drinks appletini (since Tanya drinks either ros\u00e9 or an appletini, and Douglas is the only one left).\n- Tanya lives in a mobile home and drinks ros\u00e9.",

The three people are the one with the townhouse, the one who drinks appletini, and Christina.\n   - This clue tells us that Christina does not live in a townhouse, and the person who drinks appletini is not Christina.\n\n2. Neither the person who lives in a chateau nor the one who lives in a mobile home is named Christina.\n   - This clue confirms that Christina does not live in a chateau or a mobile home.\n\n3. The person who drinks an appletini is either Douglas or James.\n   - This clue narrows down the options for the person who drinks appletini.\n\n4. Of James and the person who lives in a split-level house, one drinks appletini, and the other drinks scotch.\n   - This clue tells us that James either drinks appletini or scotch, and the person who lives in a split-level house drinks the other beverage.\n\n5. Tanya either drinks scotch or protein shakes.\n   - This clue gives us two options for Tanya's beverage.\n\n6. The person whose name is Tanya lives in a mobile home.\n   - This clue tells us that Tanya lives in a mobile home.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- From clue 6, we know Tanya lives in a mobile home.\n- From clue 5, Tanya either drinks scotch or protein shakes.\n- From clue 4, James either drinks appletini or scotch. If James drinks scotch, then the person who lives in a split-level house drinks appletini. But we already know that the person who drinks appletini is either Douglas or James (clue 3). Therefore, James cannot drink scotch, and he must drink appletini.\n- From clue 4, since James drinks appletini, the person who lives in a split-level house drinks scotch.\n- From clue 2, Christina does not live in a chateau or a mobile home. Since Tanya lives in a mobile home, Christina must live in either a townhouse or a split-level house. But we know that the person who lives in a split-level house drinks scotch (clue 4), and Christina is not the person who drinks scotch (clue 1). Therefore, Christina must live in a townhouse.\n- From clue 1, the three people are the one with the townhouse (Christina), the one who drinks appletini (James), and the third person must be Douglas, who drinks the remaining beverage, ros\u00e9.\n- From clue 5, Tanya either drinks scotch or protein shakes. Since the person who lives in a split-level house drinks scotch (clue 4), Tanya must drink protein shakes.",
