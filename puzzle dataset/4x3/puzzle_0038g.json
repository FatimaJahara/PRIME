                    "reasoning": "From Clue 1, we know that Casey and the person who likes X-Force are either a nurse or a civil engineer. Since Casey can't be both, we can conclude that Casey is a nurse and the person who likes X-Force is a civil engineer.\n\nFrom Clue 2, we know that the person who likes Kitty Pryde is either a midwife or named April. Since April can't like X-Force (Clue 4), April must like Kitty Pryde. Therefore, the person who likes Kitty Pryde is April, and April is a midwife (Clue 5).\n\nFrom Clue 3, we know that Rachel is either a midwife or a civil engineer. Since April is already a midwife, Rachel must be a civil engineer.\n\nFrom Clue 6, we know that neither the nurse nor the civil engineer has Gamora as their Marvel character. Since Casey is a nurse and Rachel is a civil engineer, Gamora must be paired with either Timothy or April. But April already likes Kitty Pryde, so Gamora must be paired with Timothy.\n\nFrom Clue 7, we know that the person who likes X-Force is either a nurse or named Rachel. Since Casey is already a nurse, the person who likes X-Force must be Rachel. But Rachel is a civil engineer, so this clue is actually telling us that Rachel likes X-Force.\n\nFrom Clue 8, we know that the person who works as a postmaster is either named April or has Kitty Pryde as their Marvel character. Since April is already a midwife, the postmaster must have Kitty Pryde as their Marvel character. But April already likes Kitty Pryde, so this clue is actually telling us that April is not the postmaster. Therefore, the postmaster must be either Timothy or Casey. But Casey is already a nurse, so the postmaster must be Timothy.\n\nFrom Clue 9, we know that the person whose occupation is midwife does not like Gamora as their Marvel character. This clue is already satisfied by the previous deductions.\n\nFrom Clue 10, we know that the person who likes the X-Force Marvel characters is either a nurse or named Rachel. This clue is already satisfied by the previous deductions.\n\nFrom Clue 11, we know that the person who is a nurse either has Drax the Destroyer or Kitty Pryde as their Marvel character. Since Casey is a nurse and April already likes Kitty Pryde, Casey must like Drax the Destroyer.",
