This means that Person D cannot have the APL Temasek, because if they did, the person who does pool maintenance would have the Disney Wish, but we don't know who that person is yet. Therefore, Person D must have the Disney Wish, and the person who does pool maintenance must have the APL Temasek.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that one of Person C and Person D has the Costa Toscana ship, and the other's household chore is cooking. Since Person D has the Disney Wish, Person C must have the Costa Toscana ship. This also means that Person D's household chore is cooking.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that one of Person C and the person who has the Disney Wish builds cabinets, and the other cooks. Since Person D has the Disney Wish and cooks, Person C must build cabinets.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n```\n{\n    \"Person A\": {\n        \"Household chore\": \"?\",\n        \"Ship\": \"?\"\n    },\n    \"Person B\": {\n        \"Household chore\": \"?\",\n        \"Ship\": \"?\"\n    },\n    \"Person C\": {\n        \"Household chore\": \"building cabinets\",\n        \"Ship\": \"Costa Toscana\"\n    },\n    \"Person D\": {\n        \"Household chore\": \"cooking\",\n        \"Ship\": \"Disney Wish\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFrom the first clue, we know that the person whose ship is the APL Temasek is either Person B or Person C. But we already know that Person C has the Costa Toscana ship, so Person B must have the APL Temasek.\n\nThe only household chore left is meal planning, which must be Person A's chore. The only ship left is the JS Izumo, which must be Person A's ship.\n\nHere is the completed grid:",

Since the APL Temasek is either George's or Candice's ship, Kristin cannot have the APL Temasek. Therefore, Kristin must have the Disney Wish, and the person who does pool maintenance must have the APL Temasek.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that Candice and Kristin have the Costa Toscana and meal planning, respectively. Since Kristin already has the Disney Wish, Candice must have the Costa Toscana.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that Candice and the person with the Disney Wish (Kristin) do cooking and meal planning, respectively. Therefore, Candice does cooking.\n\nNow, we can start filling in the grid:\n\n```\n{\n    \"jerry\": {\n        \"Household chore\": \"?\",\n        \"Ship\": \"?\"\n    },\n    \"george\": {\n        \"Household chore\": \"?\",\n        \"Ship\": \"?\"\n    },\n    \"candice\": {\n        \"Household chore\": \"cooking\",\n        \"Ship\": \"Costa Toscana\"\n    },\n    \"kristin\": {\n        \"Household chore\": \"meal planning\",\n        \"Ship\": \"Disney Wish\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSince Candice has the Costa Toscana, George must have the APL Temasek (from the first clue).

Since the APL Temasek is either George's or Candice's ship, Kristin's ship must be either the Disney Wish or the Costa Toscana. Also, the person who does meal planning cannot be Kristin, because they have different ships.\n\nFrom the third clue, we know that Candice and Kristin have different ships, and one of them is responsible for pool maintenance. Since Candice's ship is either the APL Temasek or the Costa Toscana, Kristin's ship must be the Disney Wish. Also, the person who does pool maintenance cannot be Candice, because they have different ships.\n\nFrom the fourth clue, we know that Candice and the person with the Disney Wish have different household chores, and one of them builds cabinets and the other does pool maintenance. Since Kristin's ship is the Disney Wish, Candice's household chore must be building cabinets.\n\nNow we can start filling in the grid:\n\n* Candice: builds cabinets, APL Temasek (from the first clue)\n* Kristin: ?, Disney Wish\n\nFrom the second clue, we know that the person who does meal planning has the APL Temasek.
