                    "reasoning": "From the given clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The person who enjoys puzzle locks either has Xbox as their shopping preference or is Person D.\n2. The person who participates in a spelling bee does not prefer shopping for yoga gear.\n3. Neither the person who enjoys spelling bee nor the one who enjoys sudoku is Person B.\n4. The three people are the one with the spelling bee puzzle, the one named Person C, and the one who prefers moisturizer.\n5. The three people are the one who prefers Xbox, the one who likes hidden object puzzles, and Person C.\n6. Neither the person who prefers moisturizer nor the one who prefers yoga gear is Person B.\n7. The three people are the one who prefers Xbox, the one named Person C, and the one with puzzle locks.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that Person C is one of the three people, and from clue 5, we know that Person C is also one of the three people. Therefore, Person C must be the one who prefers moisturizer.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that the person who participates in a spelling bee does not prefer shopping for yoga gear. Since Person C prefers moisturizer, the person who participates in a spelling bee must be either Person A or Person D.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who enjoys puzzle locks either has Xbox as their shopping preference or is Person D. Since Person C prefers moisturizer, the person who enjoys puzzle locks must be either Person A or Person B.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that neither the person who enjoys spelling bee nor the one who enjoys sudoku is Person B. Therefore, Person B must be the one who enjoys hidden object puzzles.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that neither the person who prefers moisturizer nor the one who prefers yoga gear is Person B. Since Person C prefers moisturizer, the person who prefers yoga gear must be either Person A or Person D.\n\nFrom clue 7, we know that the three people are the one who prefers Xbox, the one named Person C, and the one with puzzle locks. Since Person C prefers moisturizer, the person who prefers Xbox must be either Person A or Person D.\n\nNow, let's summarize what we have so far:\n\n* Person C prefers moisturizer.\n* Person B enjoys hidden object puzzles.\n* The person who participates in a spelling bee is either Person A or Person D.\n* The person who enjoys puzzle locks is either Person A or Person B.\n* The person who prefers yoga gear is either Person A or Person D.\n* The person who prefers Xbox is either Person A or Person D.\n\nFrom the above, we can conclude that:\n\n* Person A participates in a spelling bee and prefers yoga gear.\n* Person B enjoys puzzle locks and prefers Xbox.\n* Person C prefers moisturizer and enjoys hidden object puzzles.\n* Person D enjoys sudoku and prefers a smart home device.",

The person who enjoys puzzle locks either has a shopping preference for smart home devices or is named Tanya.\n2. The person who participates in a spelling bee does not prefer shopping for yoga gear.\n3. Neither the person who enjoys spelling bee nor the one who enjoys sudoku is named Wesley.\n4. The three people are the one with the spelling bee puzzle, the one named Brandi, and the one who prefers moisturizer.\n5. The three people are the one who prefers smart home devices, the one who likes hidden object puzzles, and Brandi.\n6. Neither the person who prefers moisturizer nor the one who prefers yoga gear is named Wesley.\n7. The three people are the one who prefers smart home devices, the one named Brandi, and the one with puzzle locks.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that Brandi is one of the three people, and from clue 5, we know that Brandi is also one of the three people. Therefore, Brandi must be the one who prefers moisturizer.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that the person who participates in a spelling bee does not prefer shopping for yoga gear. Since Brandi prefers moisturizer, the person who participates in a spelling bee must be either Jerry or Tanya.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who enjoys puzzle locks either has a shopping preference for smart home devices or is named Tanya. Since Brandi prefers moisturizer, the person who enjoys puzzle locks must be either Jerry or Wesley. But from clue 3, we know that neither the person who enjoys spelling bee nor the one who enjoys sudoku is named Wesley. Therefore, the person who enjoys puzzle locks must be Jerry.\n\nFrom clue 6, we know that neither the person who prefers moisturizer nor the one who prefers yoga gear is named Wesley. Since Brandi prefers moisturizer, the person who prefers yoga gear must be either Jerry or Tanya. But from clue 2, we know that the person who participates in a spelling bee does not prefer shopping for yoga gear. Therefore, the person who prefers yoga gear must be Tanya.\n\nFrom clue 7, we know that the three people are the one who prefers smart home devices, the one named Brandi, and the one with puzzle locks. Since Brandi prefers moisturizer and Jerry enjoys puzzle locks, the person who prefers smart home devices must be Wesley.\n\nFrom clue 3, we know that neither the person who enjoys spelling bee nor the one who enjoys sudoku is named Wesley. Since Wesley prefers smart home devices, the person who enjoys spelling bee must be either Jerry or Tanya. But from clue 2, we know that the person who participates in a spelling bee does not prefer shopping for yoga gear. Therefore, the person who enjoys spelling bee must be Jerry.\n\nThe only remaining puzzle type is hidden object puzzles, which must be enjoyed by Tanya.",

                    "reasoning": "From the given clues, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. The person who enjoys puzzle locks either shops for yoga gear or is named Tanya.\n2. The person who participates in a spelling bee does not prefer shopping for smart home devices.\n3. Neither the person who enjoys spelling bee nor the one who enjoys sudoku is named Wesley.\n4. The three people are the one with the spelling bee puzzle, the one named Brandi, and the one who prefers Xbox.\n5. The three people are the one who prefers yoga gear, the one who likes hidden object puzzles, and Brandi.\n6. Neither the person who prefers xbox nor the one who prefers smart home devices is named Wesley.\n7. The three people are the one who prefers yoga gear, the one named Brandi, and the one with puzzle locks.\n\nFrom clue 1, we know that the person who enjoys puzzle locks is either Tanya or shops for yoga gear. From clue 5, we know that Brandi is one of the three people who prefer yoga gear, hidden object puzzles, and Brandi. Therefore, Brandi must be the one who prefers yoga gear.\n\nFrom clue 4, we know that the three people are the one with the spelling bee puzzle, Brandi, and the one who prefers Xbox. Since Brandi prefers yoga gear, the person who prefers Xbox must be either Jerry or Wesley. But from clue 6, we know that neither the person who prefers Xbox nor the one who prefers smart home devices is named Wesley. Therefore, the person who prefers Xbox must be Jerry.\n\nFrom clue 2, we know that the person who participates in a spelling bee does not prefer shopping for smart home devices. Therefore, the person who prefers smart home devices must be either Tanya or Wesley. But from clue 3, we know that neither the person who enjoys spelling bee nor the one who enjoys sudoku is named Wesley. Therefore, the person who prefers smart home devices must be Tanya.\n\nFrom clue 7, we know that the three people are the one who prefers yoga gear, Brandi, and the one with puzzle locks. Since Brandi prefers yoga gear, the person with puzzle locks must be either Jerry or Wesley. But from clue 1, we know that the person who enjoys puzzle locks is either Tanya or shops for yoga gear. Therefore, the person with puzzle locks must be Tanya.\n\nNow we can fill in the grid:",
