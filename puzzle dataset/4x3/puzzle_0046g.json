The three people are the one with the fallopian tubes, the one who likes floral art, and Tara.\n   - This clue tells us that Tara is one of the three people, and the other two are associated with fallopian tubes and floral art.\n\n2. The person whose associated organ is the prostate does not have floral art as their decoration.\n   - This clue tells us that the person with the prostate organ cannot have floral art as their decoration.\n\n3. The person whose associated organ is the small intestine is either Casey or Holly.\n   - This clue tells us that Casey or Holly is associated with the small intestine organ.\n\n4. The person whose associated organ is the medulla oblongata has either a sword decoration or fairy lights.\n   - This clue tells us that the person with the medulla oblongata organ has either a sword or fairy lights as their decoration.\n\n5. Tara is either associated with the small intestine or the medulla oblongata.\n   - This clue tells us that Tara is associated with either the small intestine or the medulla oblongata organ.\n\n6. The person whose decoration is a sword is not named Holly.\n   - This clue tells us that Holly does not have a sword as their decoration.\n\n7. Of the person with fallopian tubes and the one with fairy lights, one is Mark, and the other is Tara.\n   - This clue tells us that Mark and Tara are associated with either fallopian tubes or fairy lights.\n\n8. Mark does not have a sword as a decoration.\n   - This clue tells us that Mark does not have a sword as their decoration.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- From clue 1, we know that Tara is one of the three people, and the other two are associated with fallopian tubes and floral art.\n- From clue 5, we know that Tara is associated with either the small intestine or the medulla oblongata organ.\n- From clue 3, we know that Casey or Holly is associated with the small intestine organ.\n- Since Tara is already associated with either the small intestine or the medulla oblongata, and Casey or Holly is associated with the small intestine, Tara must be associated with the medulla oblongata organ.\n- From clue 4, we know that the person with the medulla oblongata organ has either a sword or fairy lights as their decoration.\n- Since Tara is associated with the medulla oblongata organ, Tara must have either a sword or fairy lights as their decoration.\n- From clue 6, we know that Holly does not have a sword as their decoration.\n- From clue 8, we know that Mark does not have a sword as their decoration.\n- Since Tara is the only one left who can have a sword as their decoration, Tara must have a sword as their decoration.\n- From clue 7, we know that Mark and Tara are associated with either fallopian tubes or fairy lights.\n- Since Tara is already associated with the medulla oblongata organ and has a sword as their decoration, Mark must be associated with fallopian tubes and fairy lights.\n- From clue 1, we know that the three people are the one with the fallopian tubes, the one who likes floral art, and Tara.\n- Since Mark is associated with fallopian tubes, the person who likes floral art must be either Casey or Holly.\n- From clue 2, we know that the person with the prostate organ cannot have floral art as their decoration.\n- Since Casey or Holly is associated with the small intestine organ, and the person with the prostate organ cannot have floral art as their decoration, the person with the prostate organ must be either Casey or Holly.\n- Since Casey or Holly is associated with the small intestine organ, and the person with the prostate organ is either Casey or Holly, the person with the small intestine organ must be associated with floral art.\n- Therefore, the person with the small intestine organ is associated with floral art, and the person with the prostate organ is associated with vintage license plate.",

The three people are the one with the fallopian tubes, the one with the vintage license plate, and Tara.\n   - This clue tells us that Tara is one of the three people, and the other two are associated with fallopian tubes and vintage license plate.\n\n2. The person whose associated organ is the prostate does not have a vintage license plate as decoration.\n   - This clue tells us that the person with the prostate is not associated with the vintage license plate.\n\n3. The person whose associated organ is the small intestine is either Casey or Holly.\n   - This clue narrows down the options for the small intestine to either Casey or Holly.\n\n4. The person whose associated organ is the medulla oblongata either has fairy lights or a sword as their decoration.\n   - This clue tells us that the person with the medulla oblongata has either fairy lights or a sword as their decoration.\n\n5. Tara is either associated with the small intestine or the medulla oblongata.\n   - This clue tells us that Tara is associated with either the small intestine or the medulla oblongata.\n\n6. The person whose decoration is fairy lights is not named Holly.\n   - This clue tells us that the person with fairy lights is not Holly.\n\n7. Of the person with fallopian tubes and the one with a sword decoration, one is Mark, and the other is Tara.\n   - This clue tells us that Mark and Tara are associated with either fallopian tubes or a sword decoration.\n\n8. Mark does not have fairy lights as his decoration.\n   - This clue tells us that Mark does not have fairy lights as his decoration.\n\nNow, let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n- From clue 1, we know that Tara is one of the three people, and the other two are associated with fallopian tubes and vintage license plate.\n- From clue 7, we know that Mark and Tara are associated with either fallopian tubes or a sword decoration. Since Tara is already associated with either the small intestine or the medulla oblongata (clue 5), Mark must be associated with fallopian tubes.\n- From clue 7, we also know that Tara is associated with a sword decoration.\n- From clue 4, we know that the person with the medulla oblongata has either fairy lights or a sword as their decoration. Since Tara is already associated with a sword decoration, the person with the medulla oblongata must have fairy lights as their decoration.\n- From clue 6, we know that the person with fairy lights is not Holly. Therefore, the person with the medulla oblongata and fairy lights must be Casey.\n- From clue 3, we know that the person with the small intestine is either Casey or Holly. Since Casey is already associated with the medulla oblongata, the person with the small intestine must be Holly.\n- From clue 2, we know that the person with the prostate is not associated with the vintage license plate. Therefore, the person with the prostate must be associated with the remaining decoration, which is floral art.\n- From clue 1, we know that the three people are the one with the fallopian tubes, the one with the vintage license plate, and Tara. Since Mark is associated with fallopian tubes and Tara is associated with a sword decoration, the person with the vintage license plate must be the remaining person, which is Holly.",
